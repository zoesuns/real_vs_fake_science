      "2        This thesis explores the effects of <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> (DM) on neutron stars (NSs) using the relativistic mean-field (RMF) model. The effects of DM on NS properties, including the mass-radius relation, the moment of inertia, and tidal deformability, are calculated by varying its fraction. The study found that the EOS becomes softer with increasing DM momentum, and the DM has marginal effects on nuclear <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> properties, except for the EOSs and binding energy per particle. The study also calculated the properties of isolated, static, and rotating DM admixed NS and found that the DM has significant effects on both static and rotating NS. We have also observed that a tiny amount of DM can accumulate inside the NS, and more amount of it makes the NS unstable. The study also suggests that the secondary component might be a NS with DM content if the underlying nuclear EOS is sufficiently stiff. The $f$-mode oscillations of the DM admixed hyperon stars are calculated and found that there exist a correlation between canonical $f$-mode frequency and the dimensionless tidal deformability parameter ($Λ_{1.4}$) and we have put a constraint on $f$-mode frequency using GW170817 data. Finally, we have calculated the DM admixed binary NS properties and found that the binary system becomes less deformed and sustains more time in its inspiral phases with the addition of DM. Therefore, we suggest that one can take DM inside the compact objects while modeling the inspiral waveforms for the BNS systems.\n",
      "3        Radiative emissions from electrons and positrons generated by <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> (DM) annihilation or decay are one of the most investigated signals in indirect searches of WIMPs. Ideal targets must have large ratio of DM to baryonic <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>. However, such ``<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span>&#39;&#39; systems have a poorly known level of magnetic turbulence, which determines the residence time of the electrons and positrons and therefore also the strength of the expected signal. This typically leads to significant uncertainties in the derived DM bounds. In a novel approach, we compute the self-confinement of the DM-induced electrons and positrons. Indeed, they themselves generate irregularities in the magnetic field, thus setting a lower limit on the presence of the magnetic turbulence. We specifically apply this approach to dwarf spheroidal galaxies. Finally, by comparing the expected synchrotron emission with radio data from the direction of the Draco galaxy collected at the Giant Metre Radio Telescope, we show that the proposed approach can be used to set robust and competitive bounds on WIMP DM.\n",
      "4        The particle origin of <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> (DM) is still one of the main puzzles in modern physics. One of the most promising search strategy to detect DM at laboratories is through the indirect search of cosmic particles that are produced from DM annihilation in space. In particular, the flux of cosmic positrons has been measured with high precision by the AMS-02 experiment demonstrating that an excess above 10 GeV, with respect to the secondary production, is present. We study in this paper the possible DM origin of the positron excess finding the values of the DM mass $M$ and annihilation cross section $\\langle σv \\rangle$ that are needed to fit high-energy positron data. In particular, we find that for DM annihilating into $b\\bar{b}$ it is required to have $M=43$ TeV and $\\langle σv \\rangle = 10^{-21}$ cm$^3$/s while for $τ^+τ^-$ $M=2$ TeV and $\\langle σv \\rangle = 3\\times 10^{-23}$ cm$^3$/s. If DM produce positrons, they are expected to generate gamma rays from the center of the Milky Way and around dwarf galaxy satellites of the Galaxy. We thus combine the values for the DM mass and annihilation cross section obtained with the fit to AMS-02 positron data with the upper limits derived with the non-detection of $γ$ rays with HESS in the direction of the Galactic center and Fermi-LAT for the combined analysis of dwarf galaxies. The main result of the paper is that only DM annihilating into $μ^+ μ^-$ with a mass around 500 GeV and $\\langle σv \\rangle = 4\\times 10^{-24}$ cm$^3$/s can fit AMS-02 data and be compatible with the upper limits found with $γ$ rays. As for the $τ^+ τ^-$ ($b\\bar{b}$) channel, DM can contribute at most at a few tens $\\%$ (a few \\%) level.\n",
      "5        The elastic scattering between <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> (DM) and radiation can potentially explain small-scale observations that the cold <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> faces as a challenge, as damping density fluctuations via <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> acoustic oscillations in the early universe erases small-scale structure. We study a semi-analytical subhalo model for interacting <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> with radiation, based on the extended Press-Schechter formalism and subhalos&#39; tidal evolution prescription. We also test the elastic scattering between DM and neutrinos using observations of Milky-Way satellites from the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">Dark</span> Energy Survey and PanSTARRS1. We conservatively impose strong constraints on the DM-neutrino scattering cross section of $σ_{{\\rm DM}\\text{-}ν,n}\\propto E_ν^n$ $(n=0,2,4)$ at $95\\%$ confidence level (CL), $σ_{{\\rm DM}\\text{-}ν,0}&lt; 10^{-32}\\ {\\rm cm^2}\\ (m_{\\rm DM}/{\\rm GeV})$, $σ_{{\\rm DM}\\text{-}ν,2}&lt; 10^{-43}\\ {\\rm cm^2}\\ (m_{\\rm DM}/{\\rm GeV})(E_ν/E_ν^0)^2$ and $σ_{{\\rm DM}\\text{-}ν,4}&lt; 10^{-54}\\ {\\rm cm^2}\\ (m_{\\rm DM}/{\\rm GeV})(E_ν/E_ν^0)^4$, where $E_ν^0$ is the average momentum of relic cosmic neutrinos today, $E_ν^0 \\simeq 3.15 T_ν^0 \\simeq 6.1\\ {\\rm K}$. By imposing a satellite forming condition, we obtain the strongest upper bounds on the DM-neutrino cross section at $95\\%$ CL, $σ_{{\\rm DM}\\text{-}ν,0}&lt; 4\\times 10^{-34}\\ {\\rm cm^2}\\ (m_{\\rm DM}/{\\rm GeV})$, $σ_{{\\rm DM}\\text{-}ν,2}&lt; 10^{-46}\\ {\\rm cm^2}\\ (m_{\\rm DM}/{\\rm GeV})(E_ν/E_ν^0)^2$ and $σ_{{\\rm DM}\\text{-}ν,4}&lt; 7\\times 10^{-59}\\ {\\rm cm^2}\\ (m_{\\rm DM}/{\\rm GeV})(E_ν/E_ν^0)^4$.\n",
      "6        Numerous observations suggest that there exist undiscovered beyond-the-Standard-Model particles and fields. Because of their unknown nature, these exotic particles and fields could interact with Standard Model particles in many different ways and assume a variety of possible configurations. Here we present an overview of the Global Network of Optical Magnetometers for Exotic physics searches (GNOME), our ongoing experimental program designed to test a wide range of exotic physics scenarios. The GNOME experiment utilizes a worldwide network of shielded atomic magnetometers (and, more recently, comagnetometers) to search for spatially and temporally correlated signals due to torques on atomic spins from exotic fields of astrophysical origin. We survey the temporal characteristics of a variety of possible signals currently under investigation such as those from topological defect <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> (axion-like particle domain walls), axion-like particle stars, solitons of complex-valued scalar fields (Q-balls), stochastic fluctuations of bosonic <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> fields, a solar axion-like particle halo, and bursts of ultralight bosonic fields produced by cataclysmic astrophysical events such as binary black hole mergers.\n",
      "7        Recent observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) are yielding tantalizing hints of an early population of massive, bright galaxies at $z &gt; 10$, with Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) observations indicating significant dust masses in place as early as $z\\sim 7$. To understand the implications of these observations, we use the DELPHI semi-analytic model that jointly tracks the assembly of <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halos and their constituent baryons, including the key processes of dust enrichment. Our model employs only two redshift- and mass-independent free parameters that are tuned against all available galaxy data at $z \\sim 5-9$ before it is used to make predictions up to $z \\sim 20$. Our key results are: (1) the model progressively under-predicts the observed ultraviolet luminosity function (UV LF) at $z &gt; 12$; observations at $z&gt;16$ lie close to, or even above, a &#34;maximal&#34; model where all available gas is turned into stars; (2) UV selection would miss 34% of the star formation rate density at $z \\sim 5$, decreasing to 17% by $z \\sim 10$ for bright galaxies with $\\rm{M_{UV}} &lt; -19$; (3) the dust mass ($M_d$) evolves with the stellar mass ($M_*$) and redshift as $\\log(M_d) = 1.194\\log(M_*) + 0.0975z - 5.433$; (4) the escape fraction of UV photons ($f_{\\rm esc}^{\\rm UV}$) decreases with increasing mass and star formation rate. At $z \\sim 7$, $f_{\\rm esc}^{\\rm UV} \\sim 0.8~(0.1)$ for $M_* \\sim 10^9~ (10^{11}) \\, M_\\odot$ galaxies; (5) the dust temperature increases with stellar mass, ranging between $30-33$ K for $M_* \\sim 10^{9-11}M_\\odot$ galaxies at $z \\sim 7$. Finally, we predict the far infrared (FIR) LF at $z \\sim 5-20$, testable with ALMA observations, and caution that spectroscopic redshifts and dust masses must be pinned down before invoking unphysical extrema in galaxy formation models.\n",
      "8        We reexamine the consequences of perturbative unitarity on <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> freeze-out when both Sommerfeld enhancement and bound state formation affect <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> annihilations. At leading order (LO) the annihilation cross-section is infrared dominated and the connection between the unitarity bound and the upper bound on the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> mass depends only on how the different partial waves are populated. We compute how this picture is modified at next-to-leading order (NLO) with the goal of assigning a reliable theory uncertainty to the freeze-out predictions. We explicitly compute NLO corrections in a simple model with abelian gauge interactions and provide an estimate of the theoretical uncertainty for the thermal masses of heavy electroweak $n$-plets. Along the way, we clarify the regularization and matching procedure necessary to deal with singular potentials in quantum mechanics with a calculable relativistic UV completion.\n",
      "9        We provide an algorithm for evolving general spin-$s$ Gross-Pitaevskii / non-linear Schrödinger systems carrying a variety of interactions, where the $2s+1$ components of the `spinor&#39; field represent the different spin-multiplicity states. We consider many nonrelativistic interactions up to quartic order in the Schrödinger field (both short and long-range, and spin-dependent and spin-independent interactions), including explicit spin-orbit couplings. The algorithm allows for spatially varying external and/or self-generated vector potentials that couple to the spin density of the field. Our work can be used for scenarios ranging from laboratory systems such as spinor Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs), to cosmological/astrophysical systems such as self-interacting bosonic <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>. As examples, we provide results for two different setups of spin-$1$ BECs that employ a varying magnetic field and spin-orbit coupling, respectively, and also collisions of spin-$1$ solitons in <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>. Our symplectic algorithm is second-order accurate in time, and is extensible to the known higher-order accurate methods.\n",
      "10        We discuss the production of primordial black holes in an early <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> dominated era, which typically takes place in string inspired early universe cosmological models. In particular, we consider a pre-big bang scenario (extending previous results regarding formation in the radiation dominated era) where the enhancement of curvature perturbations is induced by a variation of the sound-speed parameter c_s during the string phase of high-curvature inflation. After imposing all relevant observational constraints, we find that the considered class of models is compatible with the production of a large amount of primordial black holes, in the mass range relevant to <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>, only for a small range of the parameters space. On the other hand, we find that a huge production of light primordial black holes may occur both in such <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> dominated era and in the radiation dominated one.\n",
      "11        We explore an extension of the standard $Λ$CDM model by including an interaction between neutrinos and <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>, and making use of the ground based telescope data of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT). An indication for a non-zero coupling between <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> and neutrinos (both assuming a temperature independent and $T^2$ dependent cross-section) is obtained at the 1$σ$ level coming from the ACT CMB data alone and when combined with the Planck CMB and Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) measurements. This result is confirmed by both fixing the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom in the early Universe to the Standard Model value of $N_{\\rm eff}=3.044$, and allowing $N_{\\rm eff}$ to be a free cosmological parameter. Furthermore, when performing a Bayesian model comparison, the interacting $ν$DM (+$N_{\\rm eff}$) scenario is mostly preferred over a baseline $Λ$CDM (+$N_{\\rm eff}$) cosmology. The preferred value is then used as a benchmark and the potential implications of <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter&#39;s</span> interaction with a sterile neutrino are discussed.\n",
      "12        We present an innovative approach to constraining the non-cold <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> model using a convolutional neural network (CNN). We perform a suite of hydrodynamic simulations with varying <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> particle masses and generate mock 21cm radio intensity maps to trace the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> distribution. Our proposed method complements the traditional power spectrum analysis. We compare our CNN classification results with those from the power spectrum of the differential brightness temperature map of 21cm radiation, and find that the CNN outperforms the latter. Moreover, we investigate the impact of baryonic physics on the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> model constraint, including star formation, self-shielding of HI gas, and UV background model. We find that these effects may introduce some contamination in the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> constraint, but they are insignificant when compared to the realistic system noise of the SKA instruments.\n",
      "13        The <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> power spectrum has been strongly constrained by astronomical measurements at large scales, but only weakly at small scales. Compared with the standard scenario, the deviation of the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> power spectrum at small scales has influence on the cosmological structure formation, e.g., the comoving number density of <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halos. The thermal history of the intergalactic medium (IGM) can be changed if <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> is made of weakly interacting massive particles and can annihilate into standard model particles. The changes of the evolution of IGM could leave imprints on the relevant astronomical observations. Taking into account the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> annihilation, we investigate the impact of the deviation of <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> power spectrum at small scales on the global 21-cm signal. In view of the measurements of the global 21-cm signal by the EDGES experiment, we explore the allowed parameter space of $m_s$, which describes the degree of deviation, by requiring the differential brightness temperature of the global 21-cm signal $δT_{21} \\le -50~\\rm mK$ at redshift $z=17$.\n",
      "14        Using Low Brightness Surface Galaxies (LBSG) rotational curves we inferred the free parameters of $\\ell$-boson stars as a <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> component. The $\\ell$-boson stars are numerical solutions to the non-relativistic limit of the Einstein-Klein-Gordon system, the Schrödinger-Poisson (SP) system. These solutions are parametrized by an angular momentum number $\\ell = (N-1)/2$ and an excitation number $n$. We perform a bayesian analysis by modifying the SimpleMC code to perform the parameter inference, for the cases with $\\ell = 0$, $\\ell = 1$ and multistates of $\\ell$-boson stars. We used the Akaike information criterion (AIC), Bayesian information criterion and the Bayes factor to compare the excited state ($\\ell$=1) and the multistate case with the ground state ($\\ell$=0) as the base model due to its simplicity. We found that the data in most galaxies in the sample favours the multistates case and that the scalar field mass tends to be slightly bigger than the ground state case.\n",
      "15        A long-standing observed curiosity of globular clusters (GCs) has been that both the number and total mass of GCs in a galaxy are linearly correlated with the galaxy&#39;s virial mass, whereas its stellar component shows no such linear correlation. This work expands on an empirical model for the numbers and ages of GCs in galaxies presented by Valenzuela et al. (2021) that is consistent with recent observational data from massive elliptical galaxies down to the dwarf galaxy regime. Applying the model to simulations, GC numbers are shown to be excellent tracers for the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> (DM) virial mass, even when distinct formation mechanisms are employed for blue and red GCs. Furthermore, the amount of DM smooth accretion is encoded in the GC abundances, therefore providing a measure for an otherwise nearly untraceable component of the formation history of galaxies.\n",
      "16        We analytically solve the problem of Bose star growth in the bath of gravitationally interacting particles. We find that after nucleation of this object, the bath is described by a self-similar solution of the kinetic equation, which is an attractor. Together with the conservation laws, this fixes mass evolution of the Bose star. Our results explain slowdown of the star growth at a certain &#34;core-halo&#34; mass, but also predict formation of the heavier and lighter objects in magistral <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> models.\n",
      "17        <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">Dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> subhaloes are key for the predictions of simulations of structure formation, but their existence frequently ends prematurely due to two technical issues, namely numerical disruption in N-body simulations and halo finders failing to identify them. Here we focus on the second issue, using the phase-space friends-of-friends halo finder ROCKSTAR as a benchmark (though we expect our results to translate to comparable codes). We confirm that the most prominent cause for losing track of subhaloes is tidal distortion rather than a low number of particles. As a solution, we present a flexible post-processing algorithm that tracks all subhalo particles over time, computes subhalo positions and masses based on those particles, and progressively removes stripped <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>. If a subhalo is lost by the halo finder, this algorithm keeps tracking its so-called ghost until it has almost no particles left or has truly merged with its host. We apply this technique to a large suite of N-body simulations and restore lost subhaloes to the halo catalogues, which has a dramatic effect on key summary statistics of large-scale structure. Specifically, the subhalo mass function increases by about 50% and the halo correlation function increases by a factor of two at small scales. While these quantitative results are somewhat specific to our algorithm, they demonstrate that particle tracking is a promising way to reliably follow haloes and reduce the need for orphan models. Our algorithm and augmented halo catalogues are publicly available.\n",
      "18        Ultralight bosons are predicted in many extensions to the Standard Model and are popular <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> candidates. The black hole superradiance mechanism allows for these particles to be probed using only their gravitational interaction. In this scenario, an ultralight boson cloud may form spontaneously around a spinning black hole and extract a non-negligible fraction of the black hole&#39;s mass. These oscillating clouds produce quasi-monochromatic, long-duration gravitational waves that may be detectable by ground-based or space-based gravitational wave detectors. We discuss the capability of a new long-duration signal tracking method, based on a hidden Markov model, to detect gravitational wave signals generated by ultralight vector boson clouds, including cases where the signal frequency evolution timescale is much shorter than that of a typical continuous wave signal. We quantify the detection horizon distances for vector boson clouds with current- and next-generation ground-based detectors. We demonstrate that vector clouds hosted by black holes with mass $\\gtrsim 60 M_{\\odot}$ and spin $\\gtrsim 0.6$ are within the reach of current-generation detectors up to a luminosity distance of $\\sim 1$ Gpc. This search method enables one to target vector boson clouds around remnant black holes from compact binary mergers detected by gravitational-wave detectors. We discuss the impact of the sky localization of the merger events and demonstrate that a typical remnant black hole reasonably well-localized by the current generation detector network is accessible in a follow-up search.\n",
      "19        Lithium-drifted silicon [Si(Li)] has been used for decades as an ionizing radiation detector in nuclear, particle, and astrophysical experiments, though such detectors have frequently been limited to small sizes (few cm$^2$) and cryogenic operating temperatures. The 10-cm-diameter Si(Li) detectors developed for the General Antiparticle Spectrometer (GAPS) balloon-borne <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> experiment are novel particularly for their requirements of low cost, large sensitive area (~10 m$^2$ for the full 1440-detector array), high temperatures (near -40$\\,^\\circ$C), and energy resolution below 4 keV FWHM for 20--100-keV x-rays. Previous works have discussed the manufacturing, passivation, and small-scale testing of prototype GAPS Si(Li) detectors. Here we show for the first time the results from detailed characterization of over 1100 flight detectors, illustrating the consistent intrinsic low-noise performance of a large sample of GAPS detectors. This work demonstrates the feasibility of large-area and low-cost Si(Li) detector arrays for next-generation astrophysics and nuclear physics applications.\n",
      "20        We present a study of a directional search for <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">Dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">Matter</span> boosted forward when scattered by cosmic-ray nuclei, using a module of the NEWSdm experiment. The boosted <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">Dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">Matter</span> flux at the edge of the Earth&#39;s atmosphere is expected to be pointing to the Galactic Center, with a flux 15 to 20 times larger than in the transverse direction.\n",
      "21        We investigate the reach of future gravitational wave (GW) detectors in probing inflaton couplings with visible sector particles that can either be bosonic or fermionic in nature. Assuming reheating takes place through perturbative quantum production from vacuum in presence of classical inflaton background field, we find that the spectral energy density of the primordial GW generated during inflation becomes sensitive to inflaton-<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> coupling. We conclude, obeying bounds from Big Bang Nucleosysthesis and Cosmic Microwave Background, that, e.g., inflaton-scalar couplings of the order of $\\sim\\mathcal{O}(10^{-20})$ GeV fall within the sensitivity range of several proposed GW detector facilities. However, this prediction is sensitive to the size of the inflationary scale, nature of the inflaton-<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> interaction and shape of the potential during reheating. Having found the time-dependent effective inflaton decay width, we also discuss its implications for <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> (DM) production from the thermal plasma via UV freeze-in during reheating. It is shown, that one can reproduce the observed DM abundance for its mass up to several PeVs, depending on the dimension of the operator connecting DM with the thermal bath and the associated scale of the UV physics. Thus we promote primordial GW to observables sensitive to feebly coupled inflaton, which is very challenging if not impossible to test in conventional particle physics laboratories or astrophysical measurements.\n",
      "22        We argue that demanding a consistent cosmological history, including the absence of domain walls and strongly interacting relics at the Peccei-Quinn scale, singles out two concrete realizations of hadronic QCD axions as viable <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> models. These realizations generally feature flavor-violating axion couplings to Standard Model quarks that are unsuppressed at low energies. As a consequence, experiments looking for flavor-violating hadronic processes involving the axion can be sensitive probes of QCD axion <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> models. In particular, we show that the NA62 and KOTO experiments could detect the $K\\rightarrowπ+ a$ decay for axions consistent with the observed <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> abundance via the post-inflationary misalignment mechanism.\n",
      "23        The mean <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> density within the turnaround radius, which is the boundary that separates a nonexpanding structure from the Hubble flow, was recently proposed as a novel cosmological probe. According to the spherical collapse model, the evolution with cosmic time of this turnaround density, $\\rm ρ_{ta}(z)$, can be used to determine both $\\rm Ω_m$ and $Ω_Λ$, independently of any other currently used probe. The properties of $\\rm ρ_{ta}$ predicted by the spherical collapse model were also shown to persist in the presence of full three-dimensional effects in $\\rm Λ$CDM N-body cosmological simulations when considering galaxy clusters at the present time, $z=0$. However, a small offset was discovered between the spherical-collapse prediction of the value of $ρ_{ta}$ at $z=0$ and its value measured in simulations. In this letter, we explore whether this offset evolves with cosmic time; whether it differs in different cosmologies; whether its origin can be confidently identified; and whether it can be corrected. We found that the offset does evolve slightly with redshift, and that it correlates strongly with the deviation from spherical symmetry of the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halo distribution inside and outside of the turnaround radius. We used an appropriate metric to quantify deviations in the environment of a structure from spherical symmetry. We found that using this metric, we can construct a sphericity-selected sample of halos for which the offset of $ρ_{ta}$ from the spherical collapse prediction is zero, independently of redshift and cosmology. We found that a sphericity-selected halo sample allows us to recover the simulated cosmology, and we conclude that the turnaround density evolution indeed encodes the cosmology in N-body simulations.\n",
      "24        We present a new suite of over 1,500 cosmological N-body simulations with varied Warm <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">Dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">Matter</span> (WDM) models ranging from 2.5 to 30 keV. We use these simulations to train Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to infer WDM particle masses from images of DM field data. Our fiducial setup can make accurate predictions of the WDM particle mass up to 7.5 keV at a 95% confidence level from small maps that cover an area of (25 h$^{-1}$ Mpc)$^2$. We vary the image resolution, simulation resolution, redshift, and cosmology of our fiducial setup to better understand how our model is making predictions. Using these variations, we find that our models are most dependent on simulation resolution, minimally dependent on image resolution, not systematically dependent on redshift, and robust to varied cosmologies. We also find that an important feature to distinguish between WDM models is present with a linear size between 100 and 200 h$^{-1}$ kpc. We compare our fiducial model to one trained on the power spectrum alone and find that our field-level model can make 2x more precise predictions and can make accurate predictions to 2x as massive WDM particle masses when used on the same data. Overall, we find that the field-level data can be used to accurately differentiate between WDM models and contain more information than is captured by the power spectrum. This technique can be extended to more complex DM models and opens up new opportunities to explore alternative DM models in a cosmological environment.\n",
      "25        The properties of globular clusters (GCs) contain valuable information of their host galaxies and <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span>-<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halos. In the remarkable example of ultra-diffuse galaxy, NGC5846-UDG1, the GC population exhibits strong radial mass segregation, indicative of dynamical-friction-driven orbital decay, which opens the possibility of using imaging data alone to constrain the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span>-<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> content of the galaxy. To explore this possibility, we develop a semi-analytical model of GC evolution, which starts from the initial mass function, the initial structure-mass relation, and the initial spatial distribution of the GC progenitors, and follows the effects of dynamical friction, tidal evolution, and two-body relaxation. Using Markov Chain Monte Carlo, we forward-model the GCs in a NGC5846-UDG1-like potential to match the observed GC mass, size, and spatial distributions, and to constrain the profile of the host halo and the origin of the GCs. We find that, with the assumptions of zero mass segregation when the star clusters were born, NGC5846-UDG1 is <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span>-<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> poor compared to what is expected from stellar-to-halo-mass relations, and its halo concentration is low, irrespective of having a cuspy or a cored halo profile. Its GC population has an initial spatial distribution more extended than the smooth stellar distribution. We discuss the results in the context of scaling laws of galaxy-halo connections, and warn against naively using the GC-abundance-halo-mass relation to infer the halo mass of UDGs. Our model is generally applicable to GC-rich dwarf galaxies, and is publicly available at https://github.com/JiangFangzhou/GCevo.\n",
      "26        The Epoch of Reionization (EoR) neutral Hydrogen (HI) 21-cm signal evolves significantly along the line-of-sight (LoS) due to the light-cone (LC) effect. It is important to accurately incorporate this in simulations in order to correctly interpret the signal. 21-cm LC simulations are typically produced by stitching together slices from a finite number $(N_{\\rm RS})$ of &#39;&#39;reionization snapshot&#39;&#39;, each corresponding to a different stage of reionization. In this paper, we have quantified the errors in the 21-cm LC simulation due to the finite value of $N_{\\rm RS}$. We show that this can introduce large discontinuities $(&gt; 200 \\%)$ at the stitching boundaries when $N_{\\rm RS}$ is small $(= 2,4)$ and the mean neutral fraction jumps by $δ\\bar{x}_{\\rm HI} = 0.2,0.1$ respectively at the stitching boundaries. This drops to $17 \\%$ for $N_{\\rm RS} = 13$ where $δ\\bar{x}_{\\rm HI}=0.02$. We present and also validate a method for mitigating this error by increasing $N_{\\rm RS}$ without a proportional increase in the computational costs which are mainly incurred in generating the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> and halo density fields. Our method generates these fields only at a few redshifts, and interpolates them to generate reionization snapshots at closely spaced redshifts. We use this to generate 21-cm LC simulations with $N_{\\rm RS} = 26,51,101$ and $201$, and show that the errors go down as $N_{\\rm RS}^{-1}$.\n",
      "27        The advent of gravitational wave astronomy has seen a huge influx of new predictions for potential discoveries of beyond the Standard Model fields. The coupling of all fundamental fields to gravity, together with its dominance on large scales, makes gravitational physics a rich laboratory to study fundamental physics. This holds especially true for the search for the elusive <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> photon, a promising <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> candidate. The <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> photon is predicted to generate instabilities in a rotating black hole spacetime, birthing a macroscopic Bose-Einstein condensate. These condensates can especially form around super massive black holes, modifying the dynamical inspiralling process. This then opens another window to leverage future space-borne gravitational wave antennas to join the hunt for the elusive <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> particle. This study builds a preliminary model for the gravitational waveform emitted by such a dressed extreme mass-ratio inspiral. Comparing these waveforms to the vacuum scenario allows projections to the potential constrainability on the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> photon mass by space-borne gravitational wave antennas. The superradiant instability of a massive vector field on a Kerr background is calculated and the modification to the dynamics of an inspiralling solar mass-scale compact object is determined with approximations on the backreaction effect of the cloud on the compact object. The end result is the projection that the LISA mission should be able to constrain the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> photon mass using extreme mass ratio inspirals in the range $[1.8 \\times 10^{-17}, 4.47 \\times 10^{-16}]$ eV.\n",
      "28        Recent observations made by the JWST have revealed a number of massive galaxies at high redshift ($z$). The presence of these galaxies appears at odds with the current $Λ$CDM cosmology. Here we investigate the possibility of alleviating the tension by incorporating uncertainties from three sources in counting massive galaxies at high $z$: cosmic variance, error in stellar mass estimate, and contribution by backsplash. We find that each of the sources can significantly increase the cumulative stellar mass density $ρ_*(&gt;M_*)$ at the high-mass end, and the combination of them can boost the density by more than one order of magnitude. Assuming a star formation efficiency of $ε_* \\sim 0.5$, cosmic variance alone can reduce the tension to $2σ$ level, except the most massive galaxy at $z=8$. Including in addition a lognormal dispersion with a width of 0.3 dex in the stellar mass can bring the observed stellar mass density at $z \\sim 7 - 10$ to the $2σ$ range of the cosmic variance. The tension is completely eliminated when gas stripped from backsplash halos is also taken into account. Our results highlight the importance of fully modeling uncertainties when interpreting observational data of rare objects. We use the constrained simulation, ELUCID, to investigate the descendants of high $z$ massive galaxies. We find that a significant portion of these galaxies end up in massive halos with mass $M_{\\rm halo} &gt; 10^{13} h^{-1}M_\\odot $ at $z=0$. A large fraction of central galaxies in $M_{\\rm halo} \\geqslant 10^{14.5} h^{-1}M_\\odot$ halos today are predicted to contain significant amounts of ancient stars formed in massive galaxies at $z\\sim 8$. This prediction can be tested by studying the structure and stellar population of central galaxies in present-day massive clusters.\n",
      "29        Within the $Λ$CDM cosmology, <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> haloes are comprised of both a smooth component and a population of smaller, gravitationally bound subhaloes. These components are often treated as a single halo when halo properties, such as density profiles, are extracted from simulations. Recent work has shown that density profiles change substantially when subhalo mass is excluded. In this paper, we expand on this result by analysing the change in three specific host halo properties -- concentration ($c_{\\rm{NFW}}$), spin ($λ_{\\rm Bullock}$), and shape ($c/a$), -- when calculated only from the smooth component of the halo. This analysis is performed on both Milky Way-mass haloes and cluster-mass haloes in high-resolution, zoom-in, $N$-body simulations. We find that when subhaloes are excluded the median value of (1) $c_{\\rm{NFW}}$ is enhanced by $\\approx 38 \\pm 12\\%$ and $\\approx 88 \\pm 7.7\\%$ for Milky Way mass ($10^{12.1}\\,\\text{M}_\\odot$) and cluster mass ($10^{14.8}\\,\\text{M}_\\odot$) haloes respectively, (2) $λ_{\\rm Bullock}$ is reduced for Milky Way mass by $\\approx 16 \\pm 6.8\\%$ and cluster mass haloes by $\\approx 32 \\pm 8.9\\%$. Additionally, with the removal of subhaloes, cluster mass haloes tend to become more spherical as the ratio of minor-to-major axis, $c/a$, increases by $\\approx 12 \\pm 4\\%$, whereas Milky Way mass haloes remain approximately the same shape with $c/a$ changed by $\\approx 1.2 \\pm 5.6\\%$. The fractional change of each of these properties depends primarily on the amount of mass that is removed from the halo system and, to a lesser extent, mass accretion history. Our findings demonstrate that the properties of the smooth components of <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> haloes are biased relative to the total mass of the halo including subhaloes.\n",
      "30        In order to test active galactic nucleus (AGN) unification and evolutionary models, we measured the AGN clustering properties as a function of AGN obscuration defined in terms of hydrogen column density, $N_{\\rm H}$. In addition to measuring the clustering of unobscured ($N_{\\rm H} &lt; 10^{22}\\,{\\rm cm}^{-2}$) and moderately obscured ($10^{22} \\leq N_{\\rm H} &lt; 10^{23.5}$) AGNs, we also targeted highly obscured sources ($N_{\\rm H}\\geq 10^{23.5}$) up to redshifts of $z=3$. We have compiled one of the largest samples of X-ray-selected AGNs from a total of eight deep XMM/Chandra surveys. We measured the clustering as a function of both AGN obscuration and redshift using the projected two-point correlation function, $w_{\\rm p}(r_{\\rm p})$. We modeled the large-scale clustering signal, measured the AGN bias, $b(z, N_{\\rm H})$, and interpreted it in terms of the typical AGN host <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halo, $M_{\\rm halo}(z, N_{\\rm H}$). We find no significant dependence of AGN clustering on obscuration, suggesting similar typical masses of the hosting halos as a function of $N_{\\rm H}$. This result matches expectations of AGN unification models, in which AGN obscuration depends mainly on the viewing angle of the obscuring torus. We measured, for the first time, the clustering of highly obscured AGNs and find that these objects reside in halos with typical mass $\\log M_{\\rm halo} = 12.98_{-0.22}^{+0.17} [h^{-1} M_\\odot]$ ($12.28_{-0.19}^{+0.13}$) at low $z \\sim 0.7$ (high $z \\sim 1.8$) redshifts. We find that irrespective of obscuration, an increase in AGN bias with redshift is slower than the expectation for a constant halo mass and instead follows the growth rate of halos, known as the passive evolution track. This implies that for those AGNs the clustering is mainly driven by the mass growth rate of the hosting halos and galaxies across cosmic time.\n",
      "31        Mergers between galaxy clusters are an important stage in the formation of the large-scale structure of the Universe. Some of the mergers show a spectacular bow shock that formed as a result of recent passage of a smaller cluster through a bigger one, the classic example of this being the so-called bullet cluster. In this paper, I describe ten examples of interacting clusters identified among 200 of the most massive objects, with total masses above $1.4 \\times 10^{14}$ M$_{\\odot}$, from the IllustrisTNG300 simulation by searching for prominent bow shocks in their temperature maps. Despite different mass ratios of the two merging clusters, the events are remarkably similar in many respects. In all cases, the companion cluster passed close to the main one only once, between 0.9 and 0.3 Gyr ago, with the pericenter distance of 100-530 kpc and a velocity of up to 3400 km s$^{-1}$. The subcluster, typically an order of magnitude smaller in mass than the main cluster before the interaction, loses most of its <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> and gas in the process. The displacement between the collisionless part of the remnant and the bow shock is such that the remnant typically lags behind the shock or coincides with it, with a single exception of the merger occurring with the largest velocity. Usually about 1% of the gas cells in the merging clusters are shocked, and the median Mach numbers of these gas cells are around two. Due to the relatively small size of the simulation box, no close analog of the bullet cluster was found, but I identified one case that is similar in terms of mass, velocity, and displacement. The presented cases bear more resemblance to less extreme observed interacting clusters such as A520 and Coma.\n",
      "32        Microscopic horizonless relics could form in the early universe either directly through gravitational collapse or as stable remnants of the Hawking evaporation of primordial black holes. In both cases they completely or partially evade cosmological constraints arising from Hawking evaporation and in certain mass ranges can explain the entirety of the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>. We systematically explore the stochastic gravitational-wave background associated with the formation of microscopic <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span>-<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> relics in various scenarios, adopting an agnostic approach and discussing the limitations introduced by existing constraints, possible ways to circumvent the latter, and expected astrophysical foregrounds.

      "33        In direct <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> (DM) detection via scattering off the electrons, the momentum transfer plays a crucial role. Previous work showed that for self-interacting DM, if the DM particle has a size (the so-called puffy DM), the radius effect could dominate the momentum transfer and become another source of velocity dependence for self-scattering cross section. In this work we investigate the direct detection of puffy DM particles with different radii through electron recoil. We find that comparing with the available experimental exclusion limits dominated by the mediator effect for XENON10, XENON100 and XENON1T, the constraints on the puffy DM-electron scattering cross-section become much weaker for large radius DM particles. For small-radius DM particles, the constraints remain similar to the point-like DM case.\n",
      "34        Boson stars are gravitationally bound objects that arise in ultralight <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> models and form in the centers of galactic halos or axion miniclusters. We systematically study the excitations of a boson star, taking into account the mixing between positive and negative frequencies introduced by gravity. We show that the spectrum contains zero-energy modes in the monopole and dipole sectors resulting from spontaneous symmetry breaking by the boson star background. We analyze the general properties of the eigenmodes and derive their orthogonality and completeness conditions which have non-standard form due to the positive-negative frequency mixing. The eigenvalue problem is solved numerically for the first few energy levels in different multipole sectors and the results are compared to the solutions of the Schrödinger equation in fixed boson star gravitational potential. The two solutions differ significantly for the lowest modes, but get close for higher levels. We further confirm the normal mode spectrum in 3D wave simulations where we inject perturbations with different multipoles. As an application of the normal mode solutions, we compute the matrix element entering the evaporation rate of a boson star immersed in a hot axion gas. The computation combines the use of exact wavefunctions for the low-lying bound states and of the Schrödinger approximation for the high-energy excitations.\n",
      "35        If long-range attractive forces exist and are stronger than gravity then cosmic halo formation can begin in the radiation-dominated era. We study a simple realization of this effect in a system where <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> fermions have Yukawa interactions mediated by scalar particles, analogous to the Higgs boson in the standard model. We develop a self-consistent description of the system including exact background dynamics of the scalar field, and precise modelling of the fermion density fluctuations. For the latter, we provide accurate approximations for the linear growth as well as quantitative modelling of the nonlinear evolution using N-body simulations. We find that halo formation occurs exponentially fast and on scales substantially larger than simple estimates predict. The final fate of these halos remains uncertain, but could be annihilation, <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> stars, primordial black holes, or even the existence of galaxy-sized halos at <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>-radiation equality. More generally, our results demonstrate the importance of mapping scalar-mediated interactions onto structure formation outcomes and constraints for beyond the standard model theories.\n",
      "36        Recent analysis on the stellar kinematics of ultra-faint dwarf (UFD) galaxies has put a stringent upper limit on the self-scattering cross section of <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>, i.e., $σ/m&lt;{\\cal O}(0.1)\\,{\\rm cm^2/g}$ at the scattering velocity of ${\\cal O}(10)\\,{\\rm km/s}$. Resonant self-interacting <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> (rSIDM) is one possibility that can be consistent with the UFDs and explain the low central densities of rotation-supported galaxies; the cross section is resonantly enhanced to be $σ/m = {\\cal O}(1)\\,{\\rm cm^2/g}$ around the scattering velocity of ${\\cal O}(100)\\,{\\rm km/s}$ while being suppressed at lower velocities. To further assess this possibility, since the inferred <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> distribution of halos from astrophysical observations is usually compared to that in constant-cross section SIDM (cSIDM), whether the structures of rSIDM halos can be approximated by the cSIDM halo profiles needs to be clarified. In this work, we employ the grovothermal fluid method to investigate the structural evolution of rSIDM halos in a wide mass range. We find that except for halos in a specific mass range, the present structures of rSIDM halos are virtually indistinguishable from those of the cSIDM halos. For halos in the specific mass range, the resonant self-scattering renders a break in their density profile. We demonstrate how such a density-profile break appears in astrophysical observations, e.g., rotation curves and line-of-sight velocity dispersion profiles. We show that for halos above the specific mass range, the density-profile break thermalizes to disappear before the present. We demonstrate that such distinctive thermalization dynamics can leave imprints on the orbital classes of stars with similar ages and metallicities.\n",
      "37        The E-type $α$-attractor models of single-field inflation were generalized further in order to accommodate production of primordial black holes (PBH) via adding a near-inflection point to the inflaton scalar potential at smaller scales, in good agreement with measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation. A minimal number of new parameters was used but their fine-tuning was maximized in order to increase possible masses of PBH formed during an ultra-slow-roll phase leading to a large enhancement of the power spectrum of scalar (curvature) perturbations by 6 or 7 orders of magnitude against the power spectrum of perturbations observed in CMB. It was found that extreme fine-tuning of the parameters in our models can lead to a formation of the Earth-size PBH with the masses of approximately $10^{27}$ g, still in agreement with CMB observations. Quantum corrections are known to lead to the perturbative upper bound on the amplitude of large scalar perturbations responsible for PBH production. The quantum (one-loop) corrections in our models were found to be suppressed by one order of magnitude for PBH with the masses of approximately $10^{19}$ g, which may form the whole <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> in the Universe.\n",

We study the requirements the model&#39;s parameters have to fulfill in order to reproduce the measured DM relic abundance through two possible production mechanisms in the early universe, freeze-in and misalignment, both during a standard radiation-dominated era and early <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> domination. We then study possible signals of type-II majoron DM and the present and expected constraints on the parameter space that can be obtained from cosmological observations, direct detection experiments, and present and future searches for decaying DM at neutrino telescopes and cosmic-ray experiments. We find that -- depending on the majoron mass, the production mechanism, and the value of the vacuum expectation value of the type-II triplet -- all of the three decay modes (photons, electrons, neutrinos) of majoron DM particles can yield observable signals at future indirect searches for DM. Furthermore, in a corner of the parameter space, detection of majoron DM is possible through electron recoil at running and future direct detection experiments.\n",
      "39        Running vacuum models and viscous <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> scenarios beyond perfect fluid idealization are two appealing theoretical strategies that have been separately studied as alternatives to solve some problems rooted in the $Λ$CDM cosmological model. In this paper, we combine these two notions in a single cosmological setting and investigate their cosmological implications, paying particular attention in the interplay between these two constituents in different cosmological periods. Specifically, we consider a well-studied running vacuum model inspired by renormalization group, and a recently proposed general parameterization for the bulk viscosity $ξ$. By employing dynamical system analysis, we explore the physical aspects of the new phase space that emerges from the combined models and derive stability conditions that ensure complete cosmological dynamics. We identify four distinct classes of models and find that the critical points of the phase space are non-trivially renewed compared to the single scenarios. We then proceed, in a joint and complementary way to the dynamical system analysis, with a detailed numerical exploration to quantify the impact of both the running parameter and the bulk viscosity coefficient on the cosmological evolution. Thus, for some values of the model parameters, numerical solutions show qualitative differences from the $Λ$CDM model, which is phenomenologically appealing in light of cosmological observations.\n",
      "40        The intrinsic alignment (IA) of observed galaxy shapes with the underlying cosmic web is a source of contamination in weak lensing surveys. Sensitive methods to identify the IA signal will therefore need to be included in the upcoming weak lensing analysis pipelines. Hydrodynamical cosmological simulations allow us to directly measure the intrinsic ellipticities of galaxies and thus provide a powerful approach to predict and understand the IA signal. Here we employ the novel, large-volume hydrodynamical simulation MTNG740, a product of the MillenniumTNG (MTNG) project, to study the IA of galaxies. We measure the projected correlation functions between the intrinsic shape/shear of galaxies and various tracers of large-scale structure, $w_{+g},\\ w_{+m},\\ w_{++}$ over the radial range $r_{\\rm p} \\in [0.02 , 200]\\,h^{-1}{\\rm Mpc}$ and at redshifts $z=0.0$, $0.5$ and $1.0$. We detect significant signal-to-noise IA signals with the density field for both elliptical and spiral galaxies. We also find significant intrinsic shear-shear correlations for ellipticals. We further examine correlations of the intrinsic shape of galaxies with the local tidal field. Here we find a significant IA signal for elliptical galaxies assuming a linear model. We also detect a weak IA signal for spiral galaxies under a quadratic tidal torquing model. Lastly, we measure the alignment between central galaxies and their host <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span>-<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halos, finding small to moderate misalignments between their principal axes that decline with halo mass.\n",

We explore the lensing maps over a large dynamic range in simulation mass and angular resolution, allowing us to establish a clear assessment of numerical convergence. By comparing full physics hydrodynamical simulations with corresponding <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span>-<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>-only runs we quantify the impact of baryonic physics on the most important weak lensing statistics. Likewise, we predict the impact of massive neutrinos reliably far into the non-linear regime. We also demonstrate that the &#34;fixed &amp; paired&#34; variance suppression technique increases the statistical robustness of the simulation predictions on large scales not only for time slices but also for continuously output lightcone data. We find that both baryonic and neutrino effects substantially impact weak lensing shear measurements, with the latter dominating over the former on large angular scales. Thus, both effects must explicitly be included to obtain sufficiently accurate predictions for stage IV lensing surveys. Reassuringly, our results agree accurately with other simulation results where available, supporting the promise of simulation modelling for precision cosmology far into the non-linear regime.\n",

Furthermore, <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> density perturbations that enter the horizon during an era of kination grow linearly with the scale factor prior to radiation domination.

We then use gamma-ray observations to constrain thermal <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> production during kination. The annihilation boost factor depends on the minimum halo mass, which is determined by the small-scale cutoff in the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> power spectrum.

Intriguingly, we find that the excess surface density derived from stellar kinematics in the inner region cannot be explained by simply adding an NFW <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halo extrapolated from lensing measurement at a larger scale to a stellar mass component derived from the NASA-Sloan Atlas (NSA) catalog. We find that a good fit to both data sets requires a stellar mass normalization about 3 times higher than that derived from the NSA catalog, which would require an unrealistically too-heavy initial mass function for stellar mass estimation. If we keep the stellar mass normalization to that of the NSA catalog but allow a varying inner <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> density profile, we obtain an asymptotic slope of $γ_{\\rm gnfw}$= $1.82_{-0.25}^{+0.15}$, $γ_{\\rm gnfw}$= $1.48_{-0.41}^{+0.20}$ for the group bin and the cluster bin respectively, significantly steeper than the NFW case. We also compare the total mass inner density slopes with those from Illustris-TNG300 and find that the values from the simulation are lower than the observation by at least $3σ$ level.\n",
      "44        We present dynamical scaling relations, combined with the stellar population properties, for a subsample of about 6000 nearby galaxies with the most reliable dynamical models extracted from the full MaNGA sample of 10K galaxies. We show that the inclination-corrected mass plane (MP) for both early-type galaxies (ETGs) and late-type galaxies (LTGs), which links dynamical mass, projected half-light radius $R_{\\rm e}$, and the second stellar velocity moment $σ_{\\rm e}$ within $R_{\\rm e}$, satisfies the virial theorem and is even tighter than the uncorrected one. We find a clear parabolic relation between $\\lg(M/L)(&lt;R_{\\rm e})$, the total mass-to-light ratio within a sphere of radius $R_{\\rm e}$, and $\\lgσ_{\\rm e}$, with the $M/L$ increasing with $σ_{\\rm e}$ and for older stellar populations. However, the relation for ETGs is linear and the one for the youngest galaxies is constant. We confirm and improve the relation between average logarithmic total density slopes $γ_{_{\\rm T}}$ and $σ_{\\rm e}$: $γ_{_{\\rm T}}$ become steeper with increasing $σ_{\\rm e}$ until $\\lg(σ_{\\rm e}/{\\rm km\\,s^{-1}})\\approx 2.2$ and then remain constant around $γ_{_{\\rm T}}\\approx -2.2$. The $γ_{_{\\rm T}}-σ_{\\rm e}$ variation is larger for LTGs than ETGs. At fixed $σ_{\\rm e}$ the total density profiles steepen with galaxy age and for ETGs. We find generally low <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> fractions, median $f_{\\rm DM}(&lt;R_{\\rm e})=8$ per cent, within a sphere of radius $R_{\\rm e}$. However, we find that $f_{\\rm DM}(&lt;R_{\\rm e})$ depends on $σ_{\\rm e}$ better than stellar mass: <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> increases to a median $f_{\\rm DM}=33$ percent for galaxies with $σ_{\\rm e}\\lesssim100{\\rm km\\,s^{-1}}$. The increased $f_{\\rm DM}(&lt;R_{\\rm e})$ at low $σ_{\\rm e}$ explains the parabolic $\\lg(M/L)(&lt;R_{\\rm e})-\\lgσ_{\\rm e}$ relation.\n",
      "45        We analyze the global stellar population, radial gradients and non-parametric star formation history of $\\sim 10$K galaxies from the MaNGA Survey final data release 17 (DR17), based on stellar population synthesis and full-spectrum fitting, and relate them with dynamical properties of galaxies. We confirm that stellar population correlates with stellar velocity dispersion $σ_{\\rm e}$ better than with stellar mass $M_{\\ast}$, but also find that younger galaxies are more metal-poor at fixed $σ_{\\rm e}$. Stellar age, metallicity, and mass-to-light ratio $M_{\\ast}/L$ all decrease with galaxy rotation, while radial gradients become more negative (i.e., younger, more metal-poor, and lower $M_{\\ast}/L$ in the outskirts). The trend between metallicity gradients and rotation reverses for slow rotators, which stand out for their more negative metallicity gradients than faster-rotating galaxies. We highlight a population of massive disk galaxies on the green valley, on the $(σ_{\\rm e},\\rm Age)$ plane, that show steep negative age and metallicity gradients, consistent with their old central bulges surrounded by young star-forming disks and metal-poor gas accretion. Galaxies with high $σ_{\\rm e}$, steep total mass-density slope, low <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> fraction, high $M_{\\ast}/L$, and high metallicity have the highest star-formation rate at earlier times, and are currently quenched. We discover a population of low-mass star-forming galaxies with low rotation but physically distinct from the massive slow rotators. A catalogue of the population properties is provided publicly.\n",
      "46        This is the first paper in our series on the combined analysis of the Dynamics and stellar Population (DynPop) for the MaNGA survey in the final SDSS Data Release 17 (DR17). Here we present a catalogue of dynamically-determined quantities for over 10000 nearby galaxies based on integral-field stellar kinematics from the MaNGA survey. The dynamical properties are extracted using the axisymmetric Jeans Anisotropic Modelling (JAM) method, which was previously shown to be the most accurate for this kind of study. We assess systematic uncertainties using eight dynamical models with different assumptions. We use two orientations of the velocity ellipsoid: either cylindrically-aligned JAM$_{\\rm cyl}$ or spherically-aligned JAM$_{\\rm sph}$. We also make four assumptions for the models&#39; <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> vs. luminous <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> distributions: (1) mass-follows-light, (2) free NFW <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> halo, (3) cosmologically-constrained NFW halo, (4) generalized NFW <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> halo, i.e. with free inner slope. In this catalogue, we provide the quantities related to the mass distributions (e.g. the density slopes and enclosed mass within a sphere of a given radius for total mass, stellar mass, and <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> mass components). We also provide the complete models which can be used to compute the full luminous and mass distribution of each galaxy. Additionally, we visually assess the qualities of the models to help with model selections. We estimate the observed scatter in the measured quantities which decreases as expected with improvements in quality. For the best data quality, we find a remarkable consistency of measured quantities between different models, highlighting the robustness of the results.\n",
      "47        What is the highest energy at which gravitons can be observed? We address this question by studying graviton-to-photon conversion - the inverse-Gertsenshtein effect - in the magnetic field of the Milky Way. We find that above $\\sim 1~\\mbox{PeV}$ the effective photon mass grows large enough to quench the conversion rate. The induced photon flux is comparable to the sensitivity of LHAASO to a diffuse $γ$-ray background, but only for graviton abundances of order $Ω_{\\text{gw}} h^2_0 \\sim 1$. In the future, owing to a better understanding of $γ$-ray backgrounds, larger effective areas and longer observation times, sub-PeV shimmering gravitons with a realistic abundance of $Ω_{\\text{gw}} h^2_0 \\sim 0.01$ could be detected. We show that this is achieved in a cosmologically-motivated scenario of post-recombination superheavy <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> decay. Therefore, the sub-PeV range might be the ultimate energy frontier at which gravitons can be observed.\n",
      "48        The relation between the total mass contained in the globular clusters of a galaxy and the mass of its <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halo has been found observationally to be nearly linear over five decades of mass. However, the high-mass end of this relation is not well determined from previous data and shows large scatter. We analyze the globular cluster systems (GCSs) of a homogeneous sample of 11 brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) through DOLPHOT photometry of their deep Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images in the F814W filter. We standardize the definition of $M_{GCS}$, the total GCS mass, by using the GC total population within a limiting radius of $0.1 R_{virial}$, while the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span>-<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halo mass $M_h$ is determined from the weak-lensing calibration of $M_h$ versus $M_{bary}$. When these 11 BCGs are added to the previously studied homogeneous catalogue of Virgo member galaxies, a total value for $η= M_{GCS}/M_h$ is found to be $(3.0\\pm1.8_{internal})\\times10^{-5}$, slightly higher than previous estimates but with much reduced uncertainty. Perhaps more importantly, the results suggest that the relation continues to have a near-linear shape at the highest galaxy masses, strongly reinforcing the conclusion that accreted GCs make a major contribution to the GC populations at high galaxy mass.\n",
      "49        We introduce an analytic surface density profile for <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halos that accurately reproduces the structure of simulated halos of mass $M_{\\rm vir} = 10^{7-11}\\ M_\\odot$, making it useful for modeling line-of-sight perturbers in strong gravitational lensing models. The two-parameter function has an analytic deflection potential and is more accurate than the projected Navarro, Frenk &amp; White (NFW) profile commonly adopted at this mass scale for perturbers, especially at the small radii of most relevant for lensing perturbations. Using a characteristic radius, $R_{-1}$, where the log slope of surface density is equal to $-1$, and an associated surface density, $Σ_{-1}$, we can represent the expected lensing signal from line-of-sight halos statistically, for an ensemble of halo orientations, using a distribution of {\\em projected concentration} parameters, $\\mathcal{C}_{\\rm vir} := r_{\\rm vir}/ R_{-1}$. Though an individual halo can have a projected concentration that varies with orientation with respect to the observer, the range of projected concentrations correlates with the usual three-dimensional halo concentration in a way that enables ease of use.\n",
      "50        Axions and axion-like particles (ALPs) are a prominent <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> candidate, drawing motivation in part from the axiverse of string theory. Axion-like particles can also arise as composite degrees of freedom of a <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> sector, for example, as <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> pions in <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> Quantum Chromo-Dynamics. In a <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> Standard Model (SM) wherein all 6 quark flavors are light while the photon is massive, one finds a rich low-energy spectrum of stable and ultralight particles, in the form of neutral and charged <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> scalars, and complex neutral scalars analogous to the SM kaon, with mass splittings determined by the mass and charge of the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> quarks. The model finds a natural portal to the visible sector via kinetic coupling of the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> and visible photons, and consequent millicharges for <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>. The <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> can be a mixture of all these ultralight bosonic degrees of freedom, and exhibit both parity-even and parity-odd interactions, making the theory testable at a wide variety of experiments. In context of <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> QCD with $N_f$ flavors of light quarks, this scenario predicts $N_f^2-1$ ultralight axion-like particles -- effectively an axiverse from <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> QCD. This &#39;$π$-axiverse&#39; is consistent with but makes no recourse to string theory, and is complementary to the conventional string theory axiverse.\n",
      "51        The most luminous quasars at $z &gt; 6$ are suspected to be both highly clustered and reside in the most massive <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halos in the early Universe, making them prime targets to search for galaxy overdensities and/or protoclusters. We search for Lyman-break dropout-selected galaxies using HST WFC3/ACS broadband imaging in the fields of three $6 &lt; z &lt; 7$ quasars, as well as their simultaneously observed coordinated-parallel fields, and constrain their photometric redshifts using EAZY. One field, J0305-3150, shows a volume density 10$\\times$ higher than the blank-field UV luminosity function (UVLF) at M$_{UV} &lt; -20$, with tentative evidence of a 3$σ$ overdensity in its parallel field located 15 cMpc away. Another field, J2054-0005, shows an angular overdensity within 500 ckpc from the quasar but still consistent with UVLF predictions within 3$σ$, while the last field, J2348-3054, shows no enhancement. We discuss methods for reducing uncertainty in overdensity measurements when using photometric selection and show that we can robustly select LBGs consistent with being physically associated with the quasar, corroborated by existing JWST/NIRCam WFSS data in the J0305 field. Even accounting for incompleteness, the overdensities in J0305 and J2054 are higher for brighter galaxies at short angular separations, suggesting preferential enhancement of more massive galaxies in the immediate vicinity of the quasar. Finally, we compare the LBG population with previously-identified [CII] and mm-continuum companions; the LBG overdensities are not accompanied by an enhanced number of dusty galaxies, suggesting that the overdense quasar fields are not in the bursty star-forming phase sometimes seen in high-redshift protoclusters.\n"

The effects of DM on NS properties, including the mass-radius relation, the moment of inertia, and tidal deformability, are calculated by varying its fraction. The study found that the EOS becomes softer with increasing DM momentum, and the DM has marginal effects on nuclear <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> properties, except for the EOSs and binding energy per particle. The study also calculated the properties of isolated, static, and rotating DM admixed NS and found that the DM has significant effects on both static and rotating NS. We have also observed that a tiny amount of DM can accumulate inside the NS, and more amount of it makes the NS unstable. The study also suggests that the secondary component might be a NS with DM content if the underlying nuclear EOS is sufficiently stiff. The $f$-mode oscillations of the DM admixed hyperon stars are calculated and found that there exist a correlation between canonical $f$-mode frequency and the dimensionless tidal deformability parameter ($Λ_{1.4}$) and we have put a constraint on $f$-mode frequency using GW170817 data. Finally, we have calculated the DM admixed binary NS properties and found that the binary system becomes less deformed and sustains more time in its inspiral phases with the addition of DM. Therefore, we suggest that one can take DM inside the compact objects while modeling the inspiral waveforms for the BNS systems.\n",
      "3        Radiative emissions from electrons and positrons generated by <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> (DM) annihilation or decay are one of the most investigated signals in indirect searches of WIMPs. Ideal targets must have large ratio of DM to baryonic <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>. However, such ``<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span>&#39;&#39; systems have a poorly known level of magnetic turbulence, which determines the residence time of the electrons and positrons and therefore also the strength of the expected signal. This typically leads to significant uncertainties in the derived DM bounds. In a novel approach, we compute the self-confinement of the DM-induced electrons and positrons. Indeed, they themselves generate irregularities in the magnetic field, thus setting a lower limit on the presence of the magnetic turbulence. We specifically apply this approach to dwarf spheroidal galaxies. Finally, by comparing the expected synchrotron emission with radio data from the direction of the Draco galaxy collected at the Giant Metre Radio Telescope, we show that the proposed approach can be used to set robust and competitive bounds on WIMP DM.\n",
      "4        The particle origin of <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> (DM) is still one of the main puzzles in modern physics. One of the most promising search strategy to detect DM at laboratories is through the indirect search of cosmic particles that are produced from DM annihilation in space. In particular, the flux of cosmic positrons has been measured with high precision by the AMS-02 experiment demonstrating that an excess above 10 GeV, with respect to the secondary production, is present. We study in this paper the possible DM origin of the positron excess finding the values of the DM mass $M$ and annihilation cross section $\\langle σv \\rangle$ that are needed to fit high-energy positron data. In particular, we find that for DM annihilating into $b\\bar{b}$ it is required to have $M=43$ TeV and $\\langle σv \\rangle = 10^{-21}$ cm$^3$/s while for $τ^+τ^-$ $M=2$ TeV and $\\langle σv \\rangle = 3\\times 10^{-23}$ cm$^3$/s. If DM produce positrons, they are expected to generate gamma rays from the center of the Milky Way and around dwarf galaxy satellites of the Galaxy. We thus combine the values for the DM mass and annihilation cross section obtained with the fit to AMS-02 positron data with the upper limits derived with the non-detection of $γ$ rays with HESS in the direction of the Galactic center and Fermi-LAT for the combined analysis of dwarf galaxies. The main result of the paper is that only DM annihilating into $μ^+ μ^-$ with a mass around 500 GeV and $\\langle σv \\rangle = 4\\times 10^{-24}$ cm$^3$/s can fit AMS-02 data and be compatible with the upper limits found with $γ$ rays. As for the $τ^+ τ^-$ ($b\\bar{b}$) channel, DM can contribute at most at a few tens $\\%$ (a few \\%) level.\n",

Because of their unknown nature, these exotic particles and fields could interact with Standard Model particles in many different ways and assume a variety of possible configurations. Here we present an overview of the Global Network of Optical Magnetometers for Exotic physics searches (GNOME), our ongoing experimental program designed to test a wide range of exotic physics scenarios. The GNOME experiment utilizes a worldwide network of shielded atomic magnetometers (and, more recently, comagnetometers) to search for spatially and temporally correlated signals due to torques on atomic spins from exotic fields of astrophysical origin. We survey the temporal characteristics of a variety of possible signals currently under investigation such as those from topological defect <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> (axion-like particle domain walls), axion-like particle stars, solitons of complex-valued scalar fields (Q-balls), stochastic fluctuations of bosonic <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> fields, a solar axion-like particle halo, and bursts of ultralight bosonic fields produced by cataclysmic astrophysical events such as binary black hole mergers.\n",
      "7        Recent observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) are yielding tantalizing hints of an early population of massive, bright galaxies at $z &gt; 10$, with Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) observations indicating significant dust masses in place as early as $z\\sim 7$. To understand the implications of these observations, we use the DELPHI semi-analytic model that jointly tracks the assembly of <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halos and their constituent baryons, including the key processes of dust enrichment. Our model employs only two redshift- and mass-independent free parameters that are tuned against all available galaxy data at $z \\sim 5-9$ before it is used to make predictions up to $z \\sim 20$. Our key results are: (1) the model progressively under-predicts the observed ultraviolet luminosity function (UV LF) at $z &gt; 12$; observations at $z&gt;16$ lie close to, or even above, a &#34;maximal&#34; model where all available gas is turned into stars; (2) UV selection would miss 34% of the star formation rate density at $z \\sim 5$, decreasing to 17% by $z \\sim 10$ for bright galaxies with $\\rm{M_{UV}} &lt; -19$; (3) the dust mass ($M_d$) evolves with the stellar mass ($M_*$) and redshift as $\\log(M_d) = 1.194\\log(M_*) + 0.0975z - 5.433$; (4) the escape fraction of UV photons ($f_{\\rm esc}^{\\rm UV}$) decreases with increasing mass and star formation rate. At $z \\sim 7$, $f_{\\rm esc}^{\\rm UV} \\sim 0.8~(0.1)$ for $M_* \\sim 10^9~ (10^{11}) \\, M_\\odot$ galaxies; (5) the dust temperature increases with stellar mass, ranging between $30-33$ K for $M_* \\sim 10^{9-11}M_\\odot$ galaxies at $z \\sim 7$. Finally, we predict the far infrared (FIR) LF at $z \\sim 5-20$, testable with ALMA observations, and caution that spectroscopic redshifts and dust masses must be pinned down before invoking unphysical extrema in galaxy formation models.\n",
      "8        We reexamine the consequences of perturbative unitarity on <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> freeze-out when both Sommerfeld enhancement and bound state formation affect <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> annihilations.

We compute how this picture is modified at next-to-leading order (NLO) with the goal of assigning a reliable theory uncertainty to the freeze-out predictions. We explicitly compute NLO corrections in a simple model with abelian gauge interactions and provide an estimate of the theoretical uncertainty for the thermal masses of heavy electroweak $n$-plets. Along the way, we clarify the regularization and matching procedure necessary to deal with singular potentials in quantum mechanics with a calculable relativistic UV completion.\n",

We consider many nonrelativistic interactions up to quartic order in the Schrödinger field (both short and long-range, and spin-dependent and spin-independent interactions), including explicit spin-orbit couplings. The algorithm allows for spatially varying external and/or self-generated vector potentials that couple to the spin density of the field.

      "10        We discuss the production of primordial black holes in an early <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> dominated era, which typically takes place in string inspired early universe cosmological models. In particular, we consider a pre-big bang scenario (extending previous results regarding formation in the radiation dominated era) where the enhancement of curvature perturbations is induced by a variation of the sound-speed parameter c_s during the string phase of high-curvature inflation. After imposing all relevant observational constraints, we find that the considered class of models is compatible with the production of a large amount of primordial black holes, in the mass range relevant to <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>, only for a small range of the parameters space.

An indication for a non-zero coupling between <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> and neutrinos (both assuming a temperature independent and $T^2$ dependent cross-section) is obtained at the 1$σ$ level coming from the ACT CMB data alone and when combined with the Planck CMB and Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) measurements. This result is confirmed by both fixing the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom in the early Universe to the Standard Model value of $N_{\\rm eff}=3.044$, and allowing $N_{\\rm eff}$ to be a free cosmological parameter. Furthermore, when performing a Bayesian model comparison, the interacting $ν$DM (+$N_{\\rm eff}$) scenario is mostly preferred over a baseline $Λ$CDM (+$N_{\\rm eff}$) cosmology.

We compare our CNN classification results with those from the power spectrum of the differential brightness temperature map of 21cm radiation, and find that the CNN outperforms the latter. Moreover, we investigate the impact of baryonic physics on the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> model constraint, including star formation, self-shielding of HI gas, and UV background model. We find that these effects may introduce some contamination in the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> constraint, but they are insignificant when compared to the realistic system noise of the SKA instruments.\n",
      "13        The <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> power spectrum has been strongly constrained by astronomical measurements at large scales, but only weakly at small scales. Compared with the standard scenario, the deviation of the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> power spectrum at small scales has influence on the cosmological structure formation, e.g., the comoving number density of <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halos. The thermal history of the intergalactic medium (IGM) can be changed if <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> is made of weakly interacting massive particles and can annihilate into standard model particles. The changes of the evolution of IGM could leave imprints on the relevant astronomical observations. Taking into account the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> annihilation, we investigate the impact of the deviation of <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> power spectrum at small scales on the global 21-cm signal. In view of the measurements of the global 21-cm signal by the EDGES experiment, we explore the allowed parameter space of $m_s$, which describes the degree of deviation, by requiring the differential brightness temperature of the global 21-cm signal $δT_{21} \\le -50~\\rm mK$ at redshift $z=17$.\n",
      "14        Using Low Brightness Surface Galaxies (LBSG) rotational curves we inferred the free parameters of $\\ell$-boson stars as a <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> component. The $\\ell$-boson stars are numerical solutions to the non-relativistic limit of the Einstein-Klein-Gordon system, the Schrödinger-Poisson (SP) system. These solutions are parametrized by an angular momentum number $\\ell = (N-1)/2$ and an excitation number $n$. We perform a bayesian analysis by modifying the SimpleMC code to perform the parameter inference, for the cases with $\\ell = 0$, $\\ell = 1$ and multistates of $\\ell$-boson stars. We used the Akaike information criterion (AIC), Bayesian information criterion and the Bayes factor to compare the excited state ($\\ell$=1) and the multistate case with the ground state ($\\ell$=0) as the base model due to its simplicity. We found that the data in most galaxies in the sample favours the multistates case and that the scalar field mass tends to be slightly bigger than the ground state case.\n",
      "15        A long-standing observed curiosity of globular clusters (GCs) has been that both the number and total mass of GCs in a galaxy are linearly correlated with the galaxy&#39;s virial mass, whereas its stellar component shows no such linear correlation. This work expands on an empirical model for the numbers and ages of GCs in galaxies presented by Valenzuela et al. (2021) that is consistent with recent observational data from massive elliptical galaxies down to the dwarf galaxy regime. Applying the model to simulations, GC numbers are shown to be excellent tracers for the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> (DM) virial mass, even when distinct formation mechanisms are employed for blue and red GCs. Furthermore, the amount of DM smooth accretion is encoded in the GC abundances, therefore providing a measure for an otherwise nearly untraceable component of the formation history of galaxies.\n",
      "16        We analytically solve the problem of Bose star growth in the bath of gravitationally interacting particles. We find that after nucleation of this object, the bath is described by a self-similar solution of the kinetic equation, which is an attractor. Together with the conservation laws, this fixes mass evolution of the Bose star. Our results explain slowdown of the star growth at a certain &#34;core-halo&#34; mass, but also predict formation of the heavier and lighter objects in magistral <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> models.\n",
      "17        <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">Dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> subhaloes are key for the predictions of simulations of structure formation, but their existence frequently ends prematurely due to two technical issues, namely numerical disruption in N-body simulations and halo finders failing to identify them. Here we focus on the second issue, using the phase-space friends-of-friends halo finder ROCKSTAR as a benchmark (though we expect our results to translate to comparable codes). We confirm that the most prominent cause for losing track of subhaloes is tidal distortion rather than a low number of particles. As a solution, we present a flexible post-processing algorithm that tracks all subhalo particles over time, computes subhalo positions and masses based on those particles, and progressively removes stripped <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>. If a subhalo is lost by the halo finder, this algorithm keeps tracking its so-called ghost until it has almost no particles left or has truly merged with its host. We apply this technique to a large suite of N-body simulations and restore lost subhaloes to the halo catalogues, which has a dramatic effect on key summary statistics of large-scale structure. Specifically, the subhalo mass function increases by about 50% and the halo correlation function increases by a factor of two at small scales. While these quantitative results are somewhat specific to our algorithm, they demonstrate that particle tracking is a promising way to reliably follow haloes and reduce the need for orphan models. Our algorithm and augmented halo catalogues are publicly available.\n",
      "18        Ultralight bosons are predicted in many extensions to the Standard Model and are popular <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> candidates. The black hole superradiance mechanism allows for these particles to be probed using only their gravitational interaction. In this scenario, an ultralight boson cloud may form spontaneously around a spinning black hole and extract a non-negligible fraction of the black hole&#39;s mass. These oscillating clouds produce quasi-monochromatic, long-duration gravitational waves that may be detectable by ground-based or space-based gravitational wave detectors. We discuss the capability of a new long-duration signal tracking method, based on a hidden Markov model, to detect gravitational wave signals generated by ultralight vector boson clouds, including cases where the signal frequency evolution timescale is much shorter than that of a typical continuous wave signal. We quantify the detection horizon distances for vector boson clouds with current- and next-generation ground-based detectors. We demonstrate that vector clouds hosted by black holes with mass $\\gtrsim 60 M_{\\odot}$ and spin $\\gtrsim 0.6$ are within the reach of current-generation detectors up to a luminosity distance of $\\sim 1$ Gpc. This search method enables one to target vector boson clouds around remnant black holes from compact binary mergers detected by gravitational-wave detectors. We discuss the impact of the sky localization of the merger events and demonstrate that a typical remnant black hole reasonably well-localized by the current generation detector network is accessible in a follow-up search.\n",
      "19        Lithium-drifted silicon [Si(Li)] has been used for decades as an ionizing radiation detector in nuclear, particle, and astrophysical experiments, though such detectors have frequently been limited to small sizes (few cm$^2$) and cryogenic operating temperatures. The 10-cm-diameter Si(Li) detectors developed for the General Antiparticle Spectrometer (GAPS) balloon-borne <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> experiment are novel particularly for their requirements of low cost, large sensitive area (~10 m$^2$ for the full 1440-detector array), high temperatures (near -40$\\,^\\circ$C), and energy resolution below 4 keV FWHM for 20--100-keV x-rays. Previous works have discussed the manufacturing, passivation, and small-scale testing of prototype GAPS Si(Li) detectors. Here we show for the first time the results from detailed characterization of over 1100 flight detectors, illustrating the consistent intrinsic low-noise performance of a large sample of GAPS detectors. This work demonstrates the feasibility of large-area and low-cost Si(Li) detector arrays for next-generation astrophysics and nuclear physics applications.\n",

The boosted <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">Dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">Matter</span> flux at the edge of the Earth&#39;s atmosphere is expected to be pointing to the Galactic Center, with a flux 15 to 20 times larger than in the transverse direction.\n",
      "21        We investigate the reach of future gravitational wave (GW) detectors in probing inflaton couplings with visible sector particles that can either be bosonic or fermionic in nature. Assuming reheating takes place through perturbative quantum production from vacuum in presence of classical inflaton background field, we find that the spectral energy density of the primordial GW generated during inflation becomes sensitive to inflaton-<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> coupling. We conclude, obeying bounds from Big Bang Nucleosysthesis and Cosmic Microwave Background, that, e.g., inflaton-scalar couplings of the order of $\\sim\\mathcal{O}(10^{-20})$ GeV fall within the sensitivity range of several proposed GW detector facilities. However, this prediction is sensitive to the size of the inflationary scale, nature of the inflaton-<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> interaction and shape of the potential during reheating. Having found the time-dependent effective inflaton decay width, we also discuss its implications for <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> (DM) production from the thermal plasma via UV freeze-in during reheating. It is shown, that one can reproduce the observed DM abundance for its mass up to several PeVs, depending on the dimension of the operator connecting DM with the thermal bath and the associated scale of the UV physics. Thus we promote primordial GW to observables sensitive to feebly coupled inflaton, which is very challenging if not impossible to test in conventional particle physics laboratories or astrophysical measurements.\n",
      "22        We argue that demanding a consistent cosmological history, including the absence of domain walls and strongly interacting relics at the Peccei-Quinn scale, singles out two concrete realizations of hadronic QCD axions as viable <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> models. These realizations generally feature flavor-violating axion couplings to Standard Model quarks that are unsuppressed at low energies. As a consequence, experiments looking for flavor-violating hadronic processes involving the axion can be sensitive probes of QCD axion <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> models. In particular, we show that the NA62 and KOTO experiments could detect the $K\\rightarrowπ+ a$ decay for axions consistent with the observed <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> abundance via the post-inflationary misalignment mechanism.\n",
      "23        The mean <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> density within the turnaround radius, which is the boundary that separates a nonexpanding structure from the Hubble flow, was recently proposed as a novel cosmological probe. According to the spherical collapse model, the evolution with cosmic time of this turnaround density, $\\rm ρ_{ta}(z)$, can be used to determine both $\\rm Ω_m$ and $Ω_Λ$, independently of any other currently used probe. The properties of $\\rm ρ_{ta}$ predicted by the spherical collapse model were also shown to persist in the presence of full three-dimensional effects in $\\rm Λ$CDM N-body cosmological simulations when considering galaxy clusters at the present time, $z=0$. However, a small offset was discovered between the spherical-collapse prediction of the value of $ρ_{ta}$ at $z=0$ and its value measured in simulations. In this letter, we explore whether this offset evolves with cosmic time; whether it differs in different cosmologies; whether its origin can be confidently identified; and whether it can be corrected. We found that the offset does evolve slightly with redshift, and that it correlates strongly with the deviation from spherical symmetry of the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halo distribution inside and outside of the turnaround radius. We used an appropriate metric to quantify deviations in the environment of a structure from spherical symmetry. We found that using this metric, we can construct a sphericity-selected sample of halos for which the offset of $ρ_{ta}$ from the spherical collapse prediction is zero, independently of redshift and cosmology. We found that a sphericity-selected halo sample allows us to recover the simulated cosmology, and we conclude that the turnaround density evolution indeed encodes the cosmology in N-body simulations.\n",
      "24        We present a new suite of over 1,500 cosmological N-body simulations with varied Warm <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">Dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">Matter</span> (WDM) models ranging from 2.5 to 30 keV. We use these simulations to train Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to infer WDM particle masses from images of DM field data. Our fiducial setup can make accurate predictions of the WDM particle mass up to 7.5 keV at a 95% confidence level from small maps that cover an area of (25 h$^{-1}$ Mpc)$^2$. We vary the image resolution, simulation resolution, redshift, and cosmology of our fiducial setup to better understand how our model is making predictions. Using these variations, we find that our models are most dependent on simulation resolution, minimally dependent on image resolution, not systematically dependent on redshift, and robust to varied cosmologies. We also find that an important feature to distinguish between WDM models is present with a linear size between 100 and 200 h$^{-1}$ kpc. We compare our fiducial model to one trained on the power spectrum alone and find that our field-level model can make 2x more precise predictions and can make accurate predictions to 2x as massive WDM particle masses when used on the same data. Overall, we find that the field-level data can be used to accurately differentiate between WDM models and contain more information than is captured by the power spectrum. This technique can be extended to more complex DM models and opens up new opportunities to explore alternative DM models in a cosmological environment.\n",
      "25        The properties of globular clusters (GCs) contain valuable information of their host galaxies and <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span>-<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halos. In the remarkable example of ultra-diffuse galaxy, NGC5846-UDG1, the GC population exhibits strong radial mass segregation, indicative of dynamical-friction-driven orbital decay, which opens the possibility of using imaging data alone to constrain the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span>-<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> content of the galaxy. To explore this possibility, we develop a semi-analytical model of GC evolution, which starts from the initial mass function, the initial structure-mass relation, and the initial spatial distribution of the GC progenitors, and follows the effects of dynamical friction, tidal evolution, and two-body relaxation. Using Markov Chain Monte Carlo, we forward-model the GCs in a NGC5846-UDG1-like potential to match the observed GC mass, size, and spatial distributions, and to constrain the profile of the host halo and the origin of the GCs. We find that, with the assumptions of zero mass segregation when the star clusters were born, NGC5846-UDG1 is <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span>-<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> poor compared to what is expected from stellar-to-halo-mass relations, and its halo concentration is low, irrespective of having a cuspy or a cored halo profile. Its GC population has an initial spatial distribution more extended than the smooth stellar distribution. We discuss the results in the context of scaling laws of galaxy-halo connections, and warn against naively using the GC-abundance-halo-mass relation to infer the halo mass of UDGs. Our model is generally applicable to GC-rich dwarf galaxies, and is publicly available at https://github.com/JiangFangzhou/GCevo.\n",
      "26        The Epoch of Reionization (EoR) neutral Hydrogen (HI) 21-cm signal evolves significantly along the line-of-sight (LoS) due to the light-cone (LC) effect. It is important to accurately incorporate this in simulations in order to correctly interpret the signal. 21-cm LC simulations are typically produced by stitching together slices from a finite number $(N_{\\rm RS})$ of &#39;&#39;reionization snapshot&#39;&#39;, each corresponding to a different stage of reionization. In this paper, we have quantified the errors in the 21-cm LC simulation due to the finite value of $N_{\\rm RS}$. We show that this can introduce large discontinuities $(&gt; 200 \\%)$ at the stitching boundaries when $N_{\\rm RS}$ is small $(= 2,4)$ and the mean neutral fraction jumps by $δ\\bar{x}_{\\rm HI} = 0.2,0.1$ respectively at the stitching boundaries. This drops to $17 \\%$ for $N_{\\rm RS} = 13$ where $δ\\bar{x}_{\\rm HI}=0.02$. We present and also validate a method for mitigating this error by increasing $N_{\\rm RS}$ without a proportional increase in the computational costs which are mainly incurred in generating the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> and halo density fields. Our method generates these fields only at a few redshifts, and interpolates them to generate reionization snapshots at closely spaced redshifts. We use this to generate 21-cm LC simulations with $N_{\\rm RS} = 26,51,101$ and $201$, and show that the errors go down as $N_{\\rm RS}^{-1}$.\n",
      "27        The advent of gravitational wave astronomy has seen a huge influx of new predictions for potential discoveries of beyond the Standard Model fields. The coupling of all fundamental fields to gravity, together with its dominance on large scales, makes gravitational physics a rich laboratory to study fundamental physics. This holds especially true for the search for the elusive <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> photon, a promising <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> candidate. The <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> photon is predicted to generate instabilities in a rotating black hole spacetime, birthing a macroscopic Bose-Einstein condensate. These condensates can especially form around super massive black holes, modifying the dynamical inspiralling process. This then opens another window to leverage future space-borne gravitational wave antennas to join the hunt for the elusive <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> particle. This study builds a preliminary model for the gravitational waveform emitted by such a dressed extreme mass-ratio inspiral. Comparing these waveforms to the vacuum scenario allows projections to the potential constrainability on the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> photon mass by space-borne gravitational wave antennas. The superradiant instability of a massive vector field on a Kerr background is calculated and the modification to the dynamics of an inspiralling solar mass-scale compact object is determined with approximations on the backreaction effect of the cloud on the compact object. The end result is the projection that the LISA mission should be able to constrain the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> photon mass using extreme mass ratio inspirals in the range $[1.8 \\times 10^{-17}, 4.47 \\times 10^{-16}]$ eV.\n",
      "28        Recent observations made by the JWST have revealed a number of massive galaxies at high redshift ($z$). The presence of these galaxies appears at odds with the current $Λ$CDM cosmology. Here we investigate the possibility of alleviating the tension by incorporating uncertainties from three sources in counting massive galaxies at high $z$: cosmic variance, error in stellar mass estimate, and contribution by backsplash. We find that each of the sources can significantly increase the cumulative stellar mass density $ρ_*(&gt;M_*)$ at the high-mass end, and the combination of them can boost the density by more than one order of magnitude. Assuming a star formation efficiency of $ε_* \\sim 0.5$, cosmic variance alone can reduce the tension to $2σ$ level, except the most massive galaxy at $z=8$. Including in addition a lognormal dispersion with a width of 0.3 dex in the stellar mass can bring the observed stellar mass density at $z \\sim 7 - 10$ to the $2σ$ range of the cosmic variance. The tension is completely eliminated when gas stripped from backsplash halos is also taken into account. Our results highlight the importance of fully modeling uncertainties when interpreting observational data of rare objects. We use the constrained simulation, ELUCID, to investigate the descendants of high $z$ massive galaxies. We find that a significant portion of these galaxies end up in massive halos with mass $M_{\\rm halo} &gt; 10^{13} h^{-1}M_\\odot $ at $z=0$. A large fraction of central galaxies in $M_{\\rm halo} \\geqslant 10^{14.5} h^{-1}M_\\odot$ halos today are predicted to contain significant amounts of ancient stars formed in massive galaxies at $z\\sim 8$. This prediction can be tested by studying the structure and stellar population of central galaxies in present-day massive clusters.\n",
      "29        Within the $Λ$CDM cosmology, <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> haloes are comprised of both a smooth component and a population of smaller, gravitationally bound subhaloes. These components are often treated as a single halo when halo properties, such as density profiles, are extracted from simulations. Recent work has shown that density profiles change substantially when subhalo mass is excluded. In this paper, we expand on this result by analysing the change in three specific host halo properties -- concentration ($c_{\\rm{NFW}}$), spin ($λ_{\\rm Bullock}$), and shape ($c/a$), -- when calculated only from the smooth component of the halo. This analysis is performed on both Milky Way-mass haloes and cluster-mass haloes in high-resolution, zoom-in, $N$-body simulations. We find that when subhaloes are excluded the median value of (1) $c_{\\rm{NFW}}$ is enhanced by $\\approx 38 \\pm 12\\%$ and $\\approx 88 \\pm 7.7\\%$ for Milky Way mass ($10^{12.1}\\,\\text{M}_\\odot$) and cluster mass ($10^{14.8}\\,\\text{M}_\\odot$) haloes respectively, (2) $λ_{\\rm Bullock}$ is reduced for Milky Way mass by $\\approx 16 \\pm 6.8\\%$ and cluster mass haloes by $\\approx 32 \\pm 8.9\\%$. Additionally, with the removal of subhaloes, cluster mass haloes tend to become more spherical as the ratio of minor-to-major axis, $c/a$, increases by $\\approx 12 \\pm 4\\%$, whereas Milky Way mass haloes remain approximately the same shape with $c/a$ changed by $\\approx 1.2 \\pm 5.6\\%$. The fractional change of each of these properties depends primarily on the amount of mass that is removed from the halo system and, to a lesser extent, mass accretion history. Our findings demonstrate that the properties of the smooth components of <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> haloes are biased relative to the total mass of the halo including subhaloes.\n",
      "30        In order to test active galactic nucleus (AGN) unification and evolutionary models, we measured the AGN clustering properties as a function of AGN obscuration defined in terms of hydrogen column density, $N_{\\rm H}$. In addition to measuring the clustering of unobscured ($N_{\\rm H} &lt; 10^{22}\\,{\\rm cm}^{-2}$) and moderately obscured ($10^{22} \\leq N_{\\rm H} &lt; 10^{23.5}$) AGNs, we also targeted highly obscured sources ($N_{\\rm H}\\geq 10^{23.5}$) up to redshifts of $z=3$. We have compiled one of the largest samples of X-ray-selected AGNs from a total of eight deep XMM/Chandra surveys. We measured the clustering as a function of both AGN obscuration and redshift using the projected two-point correlation function, $w_{\\rm p}(r_{\\rm p})$. We modeled the large-scale clustering signal, measured the AGN bias, $b(z, N_{\\rm H})$, and interpreted it in terms of the typical AGN host <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halo, $M_{\\rm halo}(z, N_{\\rm H}$). We find no significant dependence of AGN clustering on obscuration, suggesting similar typical masses of the hosting halos as a function of $N_{\\rm H}$. This result matches expectations of AGN unification models, in which AGN obscuration depends mainly on the viewing angle of the obscuring torus. We measured, for the first time, the clustering of highly obscured AGNs and find that these objects reside in halos with typical mass $\\log M_{\\rm halo} = 12.98_{-0.22}^{+0.17} [h^{-1} M_\\odot]$ ($12.28_{-0.19}^{+0.13}$) at low $z \\sim 0.7$ (high $z \\sim 1.8$) redshifts. We find that irrespective of obscuration, an increase in AGN bias with redshift is slower than the expectation for a constant halo mass and instead follows the growth rate of halos, known as the passive evolution track. This implies that for those AGNs the clustering is mainly driven by the mass growth rate of the hosting halos and galaxies across cosmic time.\n",
      "31        Mergers between galaxy clusters are an important stage in the formation of the large-scale structure of the Universe. Some of the mergers show a spectacular bow shock that formed as a result of recent passage of a smaller cluster through a bigger one, the classic example of this being the so-called bullet cluster. In this paper, I describe ten examples of interacting clusters identified among 200 of the most massive objects, with total masses above $1.4 \\times 10^{14}$ M$_{\\odot}$, from the IllustrisTNG300 simulation by searching for prominent bow shocks in their temperature maps. Despite different mass ratios of the two merging clusters, the events are remarkably similar in many respects. In all cases, the companion cluster passed close to the main one only once, between 0.9 and 0.3 Gyr ago, with the pericenter distance of 100-530 kpc and a velocity of up to 3400 km s$^{-1}$. The subcluster, typically an order of magnitude smaller in mass than the main cluster before the interaction, loses most of its <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> and gas in the process. The displacement between the collisionless part of the remnant and the bow shock is such that the remnant typically lags behind the shock or coincides with it, with a single exception of the merger occurring with the largest velocity. Usually about 1% of the gas cells in the merging clusters are shocked, and the median Mach numbers of these gas cells are around two. Due to the relatively small size of the simulation box, no close analog of the bullet cluster was found, but I identified one case that is similar in terms of mass, velocity, and displacement. The presented cases bear more resemblance to less extreme observed interacting clusters such as A520 and Coma.\n",
      "32        Microscopic horizonless relics could form in the early universe either directly through gravitational collapse or as stable remnants of the Hawking evaporation of primordial black holes. In both cases they completely or partially evade cosmological constraints arising from Hawking evaporation and in certain mass ranges can explain the entirety of the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>. We systematically explore the stochastic gravitational-wave background associated with the formation of microscopic <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span>-<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> relics in various scenarios, adopting an agnostic approach and discussing the limitations introduced by existing constraints, possible ways to circumvent the latter, and expected astrophysical foregrounds.

      "33        In direct <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> (DM) detection via scattering off the electrons, the momentum transfer plays a crucial role. Previous work showed that for self-interacting DM, if the DM particle has a size (the so-called puffy DM), the radius effect could dominate the momentum transfer and become another source of velocity dependence for self-scattering cross section. In this work we investigate the direct detection of puffy DM particles with different radii through electron recoil. We find that comparing with the available experimental exclusion limits dominated by the mediator effect for XENON10, XENON100 and XENON1T, the constraints on the puffy DM-electron scattering cross-section become much weaker for large radius DM particles. For small-radius DM particles, the constraints remain similar to the point-like DM case.\n",
      "34        Boson stars are gravitationally bound objects that arise in ultralight <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> models and form in the centers of galactic halos or axion miniclusters. We systematically study the excitations of a boson star, taking into account the mixing between positive and negative frequencies introduced by gravity. We show that the spectrum contains zero-energy modes in the monopole and dipole sectors resulting from spontaneous symmetry breaking by the boson star background. We analyze the general properties of the eigenmodes and derive their orthogonality and completeness conditions which have non-standard form due to the positive-negative frequency mixing. The eigenvalue problem is solved numerically for the first few energy levels in different multipole sectors and the results are compared to the solutions of the Schrödinger equation in fixed boson star gravitational potential. The two solutions differ significantly for the lowest modes, but get close for higher levels. We further confirm the normal mode spectrum in 3D wave simulations where we inject perturbations with different multipoles. As an application of the normal mode solutions, we compute the matrix element entering the evaporation rate of a boson star immersed in a hot axion gas. The computation combines the use of exact wavefunctions for the low-lying bound states and of the Schrödinger approximation for the high-energy excitations.\n",
      "35        If long-range attractive forces exist and are stronger than gravity then cosmic halo formation can begin in the radiation-dominated era. We study a simple realization of this effect in a system where <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> fermions have Yukawa interactions mediated by scalar particles, analogous to the Higgs boson in the standard model. We develop a self-consistent description of the system including exact background dynamics of the scalar field, and precise modelling of the fermion density fluctuations. For the latter, we provide accurate approximations for the linear growth as well as quantitative modelling of the nonlinear evolution using N-body simulations. We find that halo formation occurs exponentially fast and on scales substantially larger than simple estimates predict. The final fate of these halos remains uncertain, but could be annihilation, <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> stars, primordial black holes, or even the existence of galaxy-sized halos at <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>-radiation equality. More generally, our results demonstrate the importance of mapping scalar-mediated interactions onto structure formation outcomes and constraints for beyond the standard model theories.\n",
      "36        Recent analysis on the stellar kinematics of ultra-faint dwarf (UFD) galaxies has put a stringent upper limit on the self-scattering cross section of <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>, i.e., $σ/m&lt;{\\cal O}(0.1)\\,{\\rm cm^2/g}$ at the scattering velocity of ${\\cal O}(10)\\,{\\rm km/s}$. Resonant self-interacting <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> (rSIDM) is one possibility that can be consistent with the UFDs and explain the low central densities of rotation-supported galaxies; the cross section is resonantly enhanced to be $σ/m = {\\cal O}(1)\\,{\\rm cm^2/g}$ around the scattering velocity of ${\\cal O}(100)\\,{\\rm km/s}$ while being suppressed at lower velocities. To further assess this possibility, since the inferred <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> distribution of halos from astrophysical observations is usually compared to that in constant-cross section SIDM (cSIDM), whether the structures of rSIDM halos can be approximated by the cSIDM halo profiles needs to be clarified. In this work, we employ the grovothermal fluid method to investigate the structural evolution of rSIDM halos in a wide mass range. We find that except for halos in a specific mass range, the present structures of rSIDM halos are virtually indistinguishable from those of the cSIDM halos. For halos in the specific mass range, the resonant self-scattering renders a break in their density profile. We demonstrate how such a density-profile break appears in astrophysical observations, e.g., rotation curves and line-of-sight velocity dispersion profiles. We show that for halos above the specific mass range, the density-profile break thermalizes to disappear before the present. We demonstrate that such distinctive thermalization dynamics can leave imprints on the orbital classes of stars with similar ages and metallicities.\n",
      "37        The E-type $α$-attractor models of single-field inflation were generalized further in order to accommodate production of primordial black holes (PBH) via adding a near-inflection point to the inflaton scalar potential at smaller scales, in good agreement with measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation. A minimal number of new parameters was used but their fine-tuning was maximized in order to increase possible masses of PBH formed during an ultra-slow-roll phase leading to a large enhancement of the power spectrum of scalar (curvature) perturbations by 6 or 7 orders of magnitude against the power spectrum of perturbations observed in CMB. It was found that extreme fine-tuning of the parameters in our models can lead to a formation of the Earth-size PBH with the masses of approximately $10^{27}$ g, still in agreement with CMB observations. Quantum corrections are known to lead to the perturbative upper bound on the amplitude of large scalar perturbations responsible for PBH production. The quantum (one-loop) corrections in our models were found to be suppressed by one order of magnitude for PBH with the masses of approximately $10^{19}$ g, which may form the whole <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> in the Universe.\n",
      "38        We discuss in detail the possibility that the &#34;type-II majoron&#34; -- that is, the pseudo Nambu-Goldstone boson that arises in the context of the type-II seesaw mechanism if the lepton number is spontaneously broken by an additional singlet scalar -- account for the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> (DM) observed in the universe. We study the requirements the model&#39;s parameters have to fulfill in order to reproduce the measured DM relic abundance through two possible production mechanisms in the early universe, freeze-in and misalignment, both during a standard radiation-dominated era and early <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> domination. We then study possible signals of type-II majoron DM and the present and expected constraints on the parameter space that can be obtained from cosmological observations, direct detection experiments, and present and future searches for decaying DM at neutrino telescopes and cosmic-ray experiments. We find that -- depending on the majoron mass, the production mechanism, and the value of the vacuum expectation value of the type-II triplet -- all of the three decay modes (photons, electrons, neutrinos) of majoron DM particles can yield observable signals at future indirect searches for DM. Furthermore, in a corner of the parameter space, detection of majoron DM is possible through electron recoil at running and future direct detection experiments.\n",
      "39        Running vacuum models and viscous <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> scenarios beyond perfect fluid idealization are two appealing theoretical strategies that have been separately studied as alternatives to solve some problems rooted in the $Λ$CDM cosmological model. In this paper, we combine these two notions in a single cosmological setting and investigate their cosmological implications, paying particular attention in the interplay between these two constituents in different cosmological periods. Specifically, we consider a well-studied running vacuum model inspired by renormalization group, and a recently proposed general parameterization for the bulk viscosity $ξ$. By employing dynamical system analysis, we explore the physical aspects of the new phase space that emerges from the combined models and derive stability conditions that ensure complete cosmological dynamics. We identify four distinct classes of models and find that the critical points of the phase space are non-trivially renewed compared to the single scenarios. We then proceed, in a joint and complementary way to the dynamical system analysis, with a detailed numerical exploration to quantify the impact of both the running parameter and the bulk viscosity coefficient on the cosmological evolution. Thus, for some values of the model parameters, numerical solutions show qualitative differences from the $Λ$CDM model, which is phenomenologically appealing in light of cosmological observations.\n",
      "40        The intrinsic alignment (IA) of observed galaxy shapes with the underlying cosmic web is a source of contamination in weak lensing surveys. Sensitive methods to identify the IA signal will therefore need to be included in the upcoming weak lensing analysis pipelines. Hydrodynamical cosmological simulations allow us to directly measure the intrinsic ellipticities of galaxies and thus provide a powerful approach to predict and understand the IA signal. Here we employ the novel, large-volume hydrodynamical simulation MTNG740, a product of the MillenniumTNG (MTNG) project, to study the IA of galaxies. We measure the projected correlation functions between the intrinsic shape/shear of galaxies and various tracers of large-scale structure, $w_{+g},\\ w_{+m},\\ w_{++}$ over the radial range $r_{\\rm p} \\in [0.02 , 200]\\,h^{-1}{\\rm Mpc}$ and at redshifts $z=0.0$, $0.5$ and $1.0$. We detect significant signal-to-noise IA signals with the density field for both elliptical and spiral galaxies. We also find significant intrinsic shear-shear correlations for ellipticals. We further examine correlations of the intrinsic shape of galaxies with the local tidal field. Here we find a significant IA signal for elliptical galaxies assuming a linear model. We also detect a weak IA signal for spiral galaxies under a quadratic tidal torquing model. Lastly, we measure the alignment between central galaxies and their host <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span>-<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halos, finding small to moderate misalignments between their principal axes that decline with halo mass.\n",
      "41        We study weak gravitational lensing convergence maps produced from the MillenniumTNG (MTNG) simulations by direct projection of the mass distribution on the past backwards lightcone of a fiducial observer. We explore the lensing maps over a large dynamic range in simulation mass and angular resolution, allowing us to establish a clear assessment of numerical convergence. By comparing full physics hydrodynamical simulations with corresponding <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span>-<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>-only runs we quantify the impact of baryonic physics on the most important weak lensing statistics. Likewise, we predict the impact of massive neutrinos reliably far into the non-linear regime. We also demonstrate that the &#34;fixed &amp; paired&#34; variance suppression technique increases the statistical robustness of the simulation predictions on large scales not only for time slices but also for continuously output lightcone data. We find that both baryonic and neutrino effects substantially impact weak lensing shear measurements, with the latter dominating over the former on large angular scales. Thus, both effects must explicitly be included to obtain sufficiently accurate predictions for stage IV lensing surveys. Reassuringly, our results agree accurately with other simulation results where available, supporting the promise of simulation modelling for precision cosmology far into the non-linear regime.\n",
      "42        An era of kination occurs when the Universe&#39;s energy density is dominated by a fast-rolling scalar field. <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">Dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> that is thermally produced during an era of kination requires larger-than-canonical annihilation cross sections to generate the observed <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> relic abundance. Furthermore, <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> density perturbations that enter the horizon during an era of kination grow linearly with the scale factor prior to radiation domination. We show how the resulting enhancement to the small-scale <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> power spectrum increases the microhalo abundance and boosts the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> annihilation rate. We then use gamma-ray observations to constrain thermal <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> production during kination. The annihilation boost factor depends on the minimum halo mass, which is determined by the small-scale cutoff in the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> power spectrum. Therefore, observational limits on the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> annihilation rate imply a minimum cutoff scale for a given <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> particle mass and kination scenario. For <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> that was once in thermal equilibrium with the Standard Model, this constraint establishes a maximum allowed kinetic decoupling temperature for the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>. This bound on the decoupling temperature implies that the growth of perturbations during kination cannot appreciably boost the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> annihilation rate if <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> was once in thermal equilibrium with the Standard Model.\n",
      "43        We present the measurement of total and stellar/<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> decomposed mass density profile around a sample of galaxy groups and clusters with dynamical masses derived from integral-field stellar kinematics from the MaNGA survey in Paper~I and weak lensing derived from the DECaLS imaging survey. Combining the two data sets enables accurate measurement of the radial density distribution from several kpc to Mpc scales. Intriguingly, we find that the excess surface density derived from stellar kinematics in the inner region cannot be explained by simply adding an NFW <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halo extrapolated from lensing measurement at a larger scale to a stellar mass component derived from the NASA-Sloan Atlas (NSA) catalog. We find that a good fit to both data sets requires a stellar mass normalization about 3 times higher than that derived from the NSA catalog, which would require an unrealistically too-heavy initial mass function for stellar mass estimation. If we keep the stellar mass normalization to that of the NSA catalog but allow a varying inner <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> density profile, we obtain an asymptotic slope of $γ_{\\rm gnfw}$= $1.82_{-0.25}^{+0.15}$, $γ_{\\rm gnfw}$= $1.48_{-0.41}^{+0.20}$ for the group bin and the cluster bin respectively, significantly steeper than the NFW case. We also compare the total mass inner density slopes with those from Illustris-TNG300 and find that the values from the simulation are lower than the observation by at least $3σ$ level.\n",
      "44        We present dynamical scaling relations, combined with the stellar population properties, for a subsample of about 6000 nearby galaxies with the most reliable dynamical models extracted from the full MaNGA sample of 10K galaxies. We show that the inclination-corrected mass plane (MP) for both early-type galaxies (ETGs) and late-type galaxies (LTGs), which links dynamical mass, projected half-light radius $R_{\\rm e}$, and the second stellar velocity moment $σ_{\\rm e}$ within $R_{\\rm e}$, satisfies the virial theorem and is even tighter than the uncorrected one. We find a clear parabolic relation between $\\lg(M/L)(&lt;R_{\\rm e})$, the total mass-to-light ratio within a sphere of radius $R_{\\rm e}$, and $\\lgσ_{\\rm e}$, with the $M/L$ increasing with $σ_{\\rm e}$ and for older stellar populations. However, the relation for ETGs is linear and the one for the youngest galaxies is constant. We confirm and improve the relation between average logarithmic total density slopes $γ_{_{\\rm T}}$ and $σ_{\\rm e}$: $γ_{_{\\rm T}}$ become steeper with increasing $σ_{\\rm e}$ until $\\lg(σ_{\\rm e}/{\\rm km\\,s^{-1}})\\approx 2.2$ and then remain constant around $γ_{_{\\rm T}}\\approx -2.2$. The $γ_{_{\\rm T}}-σ_{\\rm e}$ variation is larger for LTGs than ETGs. At fixed $σ_{\\rm e}$ the total density profiles steepen with galaxy age and for ETGs. We find generally low <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> fractions, median $f_{\\rm DM}(&lt;R_{\\rm e})=8$ per cent, within a sphere of radius $R_{\\rm e}$.

The increased $f_{\\rm DM}(&lt;R_{\\rm e})$ at low $σ_{\\rm e}$ explains the parabolic $\\lg(M/L)(&lt;R_{\\rm e})-\\lgσ_{\\rm e}$ relation.\n",
      "45        We analyze the global stellar population, radial gradients and non-parametric star formation history of $\\sim 10$K galaxies from the MaNGA Survey final data release 17 (DR17), based on stellar population synthesis and full-spectrum fitting, and relate them with dynamical properties of galaxies. We confirm that stellar population correlates with stellar velocity dispersion $σ_{\\rm e}$ better than with stellar mass $M_{\\ast}$, but also find that younger galaxies are more metal-poor at fixed $σ_{\\rm e}$. Stellar age, metallicity, and mass-to-light ratio $M_{\\ast}/L$ all decrease with galaxy rotation, while radial gradients become more negative (i.e., younger, more metal-poor, and lower $M_{\\ast}/L$ in the outskirts). The trend between metallicity gradients and rotation reverses for slow rotators, which stand out for their more negative metallicity gradients than faster-rotating galaxies. We highlight a population of massive disk galaxies on the green valley, on the $(σ_{\\rm e},\\rm Age)$ plane, that show steep negative age and metallicity gradients, consistent with their old central bulges surrounded by young star-forming disks and metal-poor gas accretion. Galaxies with high $σ_{\\rm e}$, steep total mass-density slope, low <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> fraction, high $M_{\\ast}/L$, and high metallicity have the highest star-formation rate at earlier times, and are currently quenched.

      "46        This is the first paper in our series on the combined analysis of the Dynamics and stellar Population (DynPop) for the MaNGA survey in the final SDSS Data Release 17 (DR17). Here we present a catalogue of dynamically-determined quantities for over 10000 nearby galaxies based on integral-field stellar kinematics from the MaNGA survey. The dynamical properties are extracted using the axisymmetric Jeans Anisotropic Modelling (JAM) method, which was previously shown to be the most accurate for this kind of study. We assess systematic uncertainties using eight dynamical models with different assumptions. We use two orientations of the velocity ellipsoid: either cylindrically-aligned JAM$_{\\rm cyl}$ or spherically-aligned JAM$_{\\rm sph}$. We also make four assumptions for the models&#39; <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> vs. luminous <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> distributions: (1) mass-follows-light, (2) free NFW <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> halo, (3) cosmologically-constrained NFW halo, (4) generalized NFW <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> halo, i.e. with free inner slope. In this catalogue, we provide the quantities related to the mass distributions (e.g. the density slopes and enclosed mass within a sphere of a given radius for total mass, stellar mass, and <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> mass components). We also provide the complete models which can be used to compute the full luminous and mass distribution of each galaxy. Additionally, we visually assess the qualities of the models to help with model selections. We estimate the observed scatter in the measured quantities which decreases as expected with improvements in quality. For the best data quality, we find a remarkable consistency of measured quantities between different models, highlighting the robustness of the results.\n",
      "47        What is the highest energy at which gravitons can be observed? We address this question by studying graviton-to-photon conversion - the inverse-Gertsenshtein effect - in the magnetic field of the Milky Way. We find that above $\\sim 1~\\mbox{PeV}$ the effective photon mass grows large enough to quench the conversion rate. The induced photon flux is comparable to the sensitivity of LHAASO to a diffuse $γ$-ray background, but only for graviton abundances of order $Ω_{\\text{gw}} h^2_0 \\sim 1$. In the future, owing to a better understanding of $γ$-ray backgrounds, larger effective areas and longer observation times, sub-PeV shimmering gravitons with a realistic abundance of $Ω_{\\text{gw}} h^2_0 \\sim 0.01$ could be detected. We show that this is achieved in a cosmologically-motivated scenario of post-recombination superheavy <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> decay. Therefore, the sub-PeV range might be the ultimate energy frontier at which gravitons can be observed.\n",
      "48        The relation between the total mass contained in the globular clusters of a galaxy and the mass of its <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halo has been found observationally to be nearly linear over five decades of mass. However, the high-mass end of this relation is not well determined from previous data and shows large scatter. We analyze the globular cluster systems (GCSs) of a homogeneous sample of 11 brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) through DOLPHOT photometry of their deep Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images in the F814W filter. We standardize the definition of $M_{GCS}$, the total GCS mass, by using the GC total population within a limiting radius of $0.1 R_{virial}$, while the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span>-<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halo mass $M_h$ is determined from the weak-lensing calibration of $M_h$ versus $M_{bary}$. When these 11 BCGs are added to the previously studied homogeneous catalogue of Virgo member galaxies, a total value for $η= M_{GCS}/M_h$ is found to be $(3.0\\pm1.8_{internal})\\times10^{-5}$, slightly higher than previous estimates but with much reduced uncertainty. Perhaps more importantly, the results suggest that the relation continues to have a near-linear shape at the highest galaxy masses, strongly reinforcing the conclusion that accreted GCs make a major contribution to the GC populations at high galaxy mass.\n",
      "49        We introduce an analytic surface density profile for <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halos that accurately reproduces the structure of simulated halos of mass $M_{\\rm vir} = 10^{7-11}\\ M_\\odot$, making it useful for modeling line-of-sight perturbers in strong gravitational lensing models. The two-parameter function has an analytic deflection potential and is more accurate than the projected Navarro, Frenk &amp; White (NFW) profile commonly adopted at this mass scale for perturbers, especially at the small radii of most relevant for lensing perturbations. Using a characteristic radius, $R_{-1}$, where the log slope of surface density is equal to $-1$, and an associated surface density, $Σ_{-1}$, we can represent the expected lensing signal from line-of-sight halos statistically, for an ensemble of halo orientations, using a distribution of {\\em projected concentration} parameters, $\\mathcal{C}_{\\rm vir} := r_{\\rm vir}/ R_{-1}$. Though an individual halo can have a projected concentration that varies with orientation with respect to the observer, the range of projected concentrations correlates with the usual three-dimensional halo concentration in a way that enables ease of use.\n",

We search for Lyman-break dropout-selected galaxies using HST WFC3/ACS broadband imaging in the fields of three $6 &lt; z &lt; 7$ quasars, as well as their simultaneously observed coordinated-parallel fields, and constrain their photometric redshifts using EAZY. One field, J0305-3150, shows a volume density 10$\\times$ higher than the blank-field UV luminosity function (UVLF) at M$_{UV} &lt; -20$, with tentative evidence of a 3$σ$ overdensity in its parallel field located 15 cMpc away. Another field, J2054-0005, shows an angular overdensity within 500 ckpc from the quasar but still consistent with UVLF predictions within 3$σ$, while the last field, J2348-3054, shows no enhancement. We discuss methods for reducing uncertainty in overdensity measurements when using photometric selection and show that we can robustly select LBGs consistent with being physically associated with the quasar, corroborated by existing JWST/NIRCam WFSS data in the J0305 field. Even accounting for incompleteness, the overdensities in J0305 and J2054 are higher for brighter galaxies at short angular separations, suggesting preferential enhancement of more massive galaxies in the immediate vicinity of the quasar. Finally, we compare the LBG population with previously-identified [CII] and mm-continuum companions; the LBG overdensities are not accompanied by an enhanced number of dusty galaxies, suggesting that the overdense quasar fields are not in the bursty star-forming phase sometimes seen in high-redshift protoclusters.\n"

The effects of DM on NS properties, including the mass-radius relation, the moment of inertia, and tidal deformability, are calculated by varying its fraction. The study found that the EOS becomes softer with increasing DM momentum, and the DM has marginal effects on nuclear <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> properties, except for the EOSs and binding energy per particle. The study also calculated the properties of isolated, static, and rotating DM admixed NS and found that the DM has significant effects on both static and rotating NS. We have also observed that a tiny amount of DM can accumulate inside the NS, and more amount of it makes the NS unstable. The study also suggests that the secondary component might be a NS with DM content if the underlying nuclear EOS is sufficiently stiff. The $f$-mode oscillations of the DM admixed hyperon stars are calculated and found that there exist a correlation between canonical $f$-mode frequency and the dimensionless tidal deformability parameter ($Λ_{1.4}$) and we have put a constraint on $f$-mode frequency using GW170817 data. Finally, we have calculated the DM admixed binary NS properties and found that the binary system becomes less deformed and sustains more time in its inspiral phases with the addition of DM. Therefore, we suggest that one can take DM inside the compact objects while modeling the inspiral waveforms for the BNS systems.\n",
      "3        Radiative emissions from electrons and positrons generated by <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> (DM) annihilation or decay are one of the most investigated signals in indirect searches of WIMPs. Ideal targets must have large ratio of DM to baryonic <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>. However, such ``<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span>&#39;&#39; systems have a poorly known level of magnetic turbulence, which determines the residence time of the electrons and positrons and therefore also the strength of the expected signal. This typically leads to significant uncertainties in the derived DM bounds. In a novel approach, we compute the self-confinement of the DM-induced electrons and positrons. Indeed, they themselves generate irregularities in the magnetic field, thus setting a lower limit on the presence of the magnetic turbulence. We specifically apply this approach to dwarf spheroidal galaxies. Finally, by comparing the expected synchrotron emission with radio data from the direction of the Draco galaxy collected at the Giant Metre Radio Telescope, we show that the proposed approach can be used to set robust and competitive bounds on WIMP DM.\n",
      "4        The particle origin of <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> (DM) is still one of the main puzzles in modern physics. One of the most promising search strategy to detect DM at laboratories is through the indirect search of cosmic particles that are produced from DM annihilation in space. In particular, the flux of cosmic positrons has been measured with high precision by the AMS-02 experiment demonstrating that an excess above 10 GeV, with respect to the secondary production, is present. We study in this paper the possible DM origin of the positron excess finding the values of the DM mass $M$ and annihilation cross section $\\langle σv \\rangle$ that are needed to fit high-energy positron data. In particular, we find that for DM annihilating into $b\\bar{b}$ it is required to have $M=43$ TeV and $\\langle σv \\rangle = 10^{-21}$ cm$^3$/s while for $τ^+τ^-$ $M=2$ TeV and $\\langle σv \\rangle = 3\\times 10^{-23}$ cm$^3$/s. If DM produce positrons, they are expected to generate gamma rays from the center of the Milky Way and around dwarf galaxy satellites of the Galaxy. We thus combine the values for the DM mass and annihilation cross section obtained with the fit to AMS-02 positron data with the upper limits derived with the non-detection of $γ$ rays with HESS in the direction of the Galactic center and Fermi-LAT for the combined analysis of dwarf galaxies. The main result of the paper is that only DM annihilating into $μ^+ μ^-$ with a mass around 500 GeV and $\\langle σv \\rangle = 4\\times 10^{-24}$ cm$^3$/s can fit AMS-02 data and be compatible with the upper limits found with $γ$ rays.

      "6        Numerous observations suggest that there exist undiscovered beyond-the-Standard-Model particles and fields. Because of their unknown nature, these exotic particles and fields could interact with Standard Model particles in many different ways and assume a variety of possible configurations. Here we present an overview of the Global Network of Optical Magnetometers for Exotic physics searches (GNOME), our ongoing experimental program designed to test a wide range of exotic physics scenarios. The GNOME experiment utilizes a worldwide network of shielded atomic magnetometers (and, more recently, comagnetometers) to search for spatially and temporally correlated signals due to torques on atomic spins from exotic fields of astrophysical origin. We survey the temporal characteristics of a variety of possible signals currently under investigation such as those from topological defect <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> (axion-like particle domain walls), axion-like particle stars, solitons of complex-valued scalar fields (Q-balls), stochastic fluctuations of bosonic <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> fields, a solar axion-like particle halo, and bursts of ultralight bosonic fields produced by cataclysmic astrophysical events such as binary black hole mergers.\n",
      "7        Recent observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) are yielding tantalizing hints of an early population of massive, bright galaxies at $z &gt; 10$, with Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) observations indicating significant dust masses in place as early as $z\\sim 7$. To understand the implications of these observations, we use the DELPHI semi-analytic model that jointly tracks the assembly of <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halos and their constituent baryons, including the key processes of dust enrichment. Our model employs only two redshift- and mass-independent free parameters that are tuned against all available galaxy data at $z \\sim 5-9$ before it is used to make predictions up to $z \\sim 20$. Our key results are: (1) the model progressively under-predicts the observed ultraviolet luminosity function (UV LF) at $z &gt; 12$; observations at $z&gt;16$ lie close to, or even above, a &#34;maximal&#34; model where all available gas is turned into stars; (2) UV selection would miss 34% of the star formation rate density at $z \\sim 5$, decreasing to 17% by $z \\sim 10$ for bright galaxies with $\\rm{M_{UV}} &lt; -19$; (3) the dust mass ($M_d$) evolves with the stellar mass ($M_*$) and redshift as $\\log(M_d) = 1.194\\log(M_*) + 0.0975z - 5.433$; (4) the escape fraction of UV photons ($f_{\\rm esc}^{\\rm UV}$) decreases with increasing mass and star formation rate. At $z \\sim 7$, $f_{\\rm esc}^{\\rm UV} \\sim 0.8~(0.1)$ for $M_* \\sim 10^9~ (10^{11}) \\, M_\\odot$ galaxies; (5) the dust temperature increases with stellar mass, ranging between $30-33$ K for $M_* \\sim 10^{9-11}M_\\odot$ galaxies at $z \\sim 7$. Finally, we predict the far infrared (FIR) LF at $z \\sim 5-20$, testable with ALMA observations, and caution that spectroscopic redshifts and dust masses must be pinned down before invoking unphysical extrema in galaxy formation models.\n",

We compute how this picture is modified at next-to-leading order (NLO) with the goal of assigning a reliable theory uncertainty to the freeze-out predictions. We explicitly compute NLO corrections in a simple model with abelian gauge interactions and provide an estimate of the theoretical uncertainty for the thermal masses of heavy electroweak $n$-plets. Along the way, we clarify the regularization and matching procedure necessary to deal with singular potentials in quantum mechanics with a calculable relativistic UV completion.\n",

We consider many nonrelativistic interactions up to quartic order in the Schrödinger field (both short and long-range, and spin-dependent and spin-independent interactions), including explicit spin-orbit couplings. The algorithm allows for spatially varying external and/or self-generated vector potentials that couple to the spin density of the field.

      "10        We discuss the production of primordial black holes in an early <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> dominated era, which typically takes place in string inspired early universe cosmological models. In particular, we consider a pre-big bang scenario (extending previous results regarding formation in the radiation dominated era) where the enhancement of curvature perturbations is induced by a variation of the sound-speed parameter c_s during the string phase of high-curvature inflation. After imposing all relevant observational constraints, we find that the considered class of models is compatible with the production of a large amount of primordial black holes, in the mass range relevant to <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>, only for a small range of the parameters space.

An indication for a non-zero coupling between <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> and neutrinos (both assuming a temperature independent and $T^2$ dependent cross-section) is obtained at the 1$σ$ level coming from the ACT CMB data alone and when combined with the Planck CMB and Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) measurements. This result is confirmed by both fixing the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom in the early Universe to the Standard Model value of $N_{\\rm eff}=3.044$, and allowing $N_{\\rm eff}$ to be a free cosmological parameter. Furthermore, when performing a Bayesian model comparison, the interacting $ν$DM (+$N_{\\rm eff}$) scenario is mostly preferred over a baseline $Λ$CDM (+$N_{\\rm eff}$) cosmology. The preferred value is then used as a benchmark and the potential implications of <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter&#39;s</span> interaction with a sterile neutrino are discussed.\n",

The $\\ell$-boson stars are numerical solutions to the non-relativistic limit of the Einstein-Klein-Gordon system, the Schrödinger-Poisson (SP) system. These solutions are parametrized by an angular momentum number $\\ell = (N-1)/2$ and an excitation number $n$. We perform a bayesian analysis by modifying the SimpleMC code to perform the parameter inference, for the cases with $\\ell = 0$, $\\ell = 1$ and multistates of $\\ell$-boson stars. We used the Akaike information criterion (AIC), Bayesian information criterion and the Bayes factor to compare the excited state ($\\ell$=1) and the multistate case with the ground state ($\\ell$=0) as the base model due to its simplicity. We found that the data in most galaxies in the sample favours the multistates case and that the scalar field mass tends to be slightly bigger than the ground state case.\n",
      "15        A long-standing observed curiosity of globular clusters (GCs) has been that both the number and total mass of GCs in a galaxy are linearly correlated with the galaxy&#39;s virial mass, whereas its stellar component shows no such linear correlation. This work expands on an empirical model for the numbers and ages of GCs in galaxies presented by Valenzuela et al. (2021) that is consistent with recent observational data from massive elliptical galaxies down to the dwarf galaxy regime. Applying the model to simulations, GC numbers are shown to be excellent tracers for the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> (DM) virial mass, even when distinct formation mechanisms are employed for blue and red GCs. Furthermore, the amount of DM smooth accretion is encoded in the GC abundances, therefore providing a measure for an otherwise nearly untraceable component of the formation history of galaxies.\n",

We find that after nucleation of this object, the bath is described by a self-similar solution of the kinetic equation, which is an attractor. Together with the conservation laws, this fixes mass evolution of the Bose star. Our results explain slowdown of the star growth at a certain &#34;core-halo&#34; mass, but also predict formation of the heavier and lighter objects in magistral <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> models.\n",
      "17        <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">Dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> subhaloes are key for the predictions of simulations of structure formation, but their existence frequently ends prematurely due to two technical issues, namely numerical disruption in N-body simulations and halo finders failing to identify them. Here we focus on the second issue, using the phase-space friends-of-friends halo finder ROCKSTAR as a benchmark (though we expect our results to translate to comparable codes). We confirm that the most prominent cause for losing track of subhaloes is tidal distortion rather than a low number of particles. As a solution, we present a flexible post-processing algorithm that tracks all subhalo particles over time, computes subhalo positions and masses based on those particles, and progressively removes stripped <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>. If a subhalo is lost by the halo finder, this algorithm keeps tracking its so-called ghost until it has almost no particles left or has truly merged with its host. We apply this technique to a large suite of N-body simulations and restore lost subhaloes to the halo catalogues, which has a dramatic effect on key summary statistics of large-scale structure. Specifically, the subhalo mass function increases by about 50% and the halo correlation function increases by a factor of two at small scales. While these quantitative results are somewhat specific to our algorithm, they demonstrate that particle tracking is a promising way to reliably follow haloes and reduce the need for orphan models. Our algorithm and augmented halo catalogues are publicly available.\n",
      "18        Ultralight bosons are predicted in many extensions to the Standard Model and are popular <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> candidates. The black hole superradiance mechanism allows for these particles to be probed using only their gravitational interaction. In this scenario, an ultralight boson cloud may form spontaneously around a spinning black hole and extract a non-negligible fraction of the black hole&#39;s mass. These oscillating clouds produce quasi-monochromatic, long-duration gravitational waves that may be detectable by ground-based or space-based gravitational wave detectors. We discuss the capability of a new long-duration signal tracking method, based on a hidden Markov model, to detect gravitational wave signals generated by ultralight vector boson clouds, including cases where the signal frequency evolution timescale is much shorter than that of a typical continuous wave signal. We quantify the detection horizon distances for vector boson clouds with current- and next-generation ground-based detectors. We demonstrate that vector clouds hosted by black holes with mass $\\gtrsim 60 M_{\\odot}$ and spin $\\gtrsim 0.6$ are within the reach of current-generation detectors up to a luminosity distance of $\\sim 1$ Gpc. This search method enables one to target vector boson clouds around remnant black holes from compact binary mergers detected by gravitational-wave detectors. We discuss the impact of the sky localization of the merger events and demonstrate that a typical remnant black hole reasonably well-localized by the current generation detector network is accessible in a follow-up search.\n",
      "19        Lithium-drifted silicon [Si(Li)] has been used for decades as an ionizing radiation detector in nuclear, particle, and astrophysical experiments, though such detectors have frequently been limited to small sizes (few cm$^2$) and cryogenic operating temperatures. The 10-cm-diameter Si(Li) detectors developed for the General Antiparticle Spectrometer (GAPS) balloon-borne <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> experiment are novel particularly for their requirements of low cost, large sensitive area (~10 m$^2$ for the full 1440-detector array), high temperatures (near -40$\\,^\\circ$C), and energy resolution below 4 keV FWHM for 20--100-keV x-rays. Previous works have discussed the manufacturing, passivation, and small-scale testing of prototype GAPS Si(Li) detectors. Here we show for the first time the results from detailed characterization of over 1100 flight detectors, illustrating the consistent intrinsic low-noise performance of a large sample of GAPS detectors.

      "21        We investigate the reach of future gravitational wave (GW) detectors in probing inflaton couplings with visible sector particles that can either be bosonic or fermionic in nature. Assuming reheating takes place through perturbative quantum production from vacuum in presence of classical inflaton background field, we find that the spectral energy density of the primordial GW generated during inflation becomes sensitive to inflaton-<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> coupling. We conclude, obeying bounds from Big Bang Nucleosysthesis and Cosmic Microwave Background, that, e.g., inflaton-scalar couplings of the order of $\\sim\\mathcal{O}(10^{-20})$ GeV fall within the sensitivity range of several proposed GW detector facilities. However, this prediction is sensitive to the size of the inflationary scale, nature of the inflaton-<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> interaction and shape of the potential during reheating. Having found the time-dependent effective inflaton decay width, we also discuss its implications for <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> (DM) production from the thermal plasma via UV freeze-in during reheating. It is shown, that one can reproduce the observed DM abundance for its mass up to several PeVs, depending on the dimension of the operator connecting DM with the thermal bath and the associated scale of the UV physics. Thus we promote primordial GW to observables sensitive to feebly coupled inflaton, which is very challenging if not impossible to test in conventional particle physics laboratories or astrophysical measurements.\n",
      "22        We argue that demanding a consistent cosmological history, including the absence of domain walls and strongly interacting relics at the Peccei-Quinn scale, singles out two concrete realizations of hadronic QCD axions as viable <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> models. These realizations generally feature flavor-violating axion couplings to Standard Model quarks that are unsuppressed at low energies. As a consequence, experiments looking for flavor-violating hadronic processes involving the axion can be sensitive probes of QCD axion <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> models. In particular, we show that the NA62 and KOTO experiments could detect the $K\\rightarrowπ+ a$ decay for axions consistent with the observed <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> abundance via the post-inflationary misalignment mechanism.\n",
      "23        The mean <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> density within the turnaround radius, which is the boundary that separates a nonexpanding structure from the Hubble flow, was recently proposed as a novel cosmological probe. According to the spherical collapse model, the evolution with cosmic time of this turnaround density, $\\rm ρ_{ta}(z)$, can be used to determine both $\\rm Ω_m$ and $Ω_Λ$, independently of any other currently used probe. The properties of $\\rm ρ_{ta}$ predicted by the spherical collapse model were also shown to persist in the presence of full three-dimensional effects in $\\rm Λ$CDM N-body cosmological simulations when considering galaxy clusters at the present time, $z=0$. However, a small offset was discovered between the spherical-collapse prediction of the value of $ρ_{ta}$ at $z=0$ and its value measured in simulations. In this letter, we explore whether this offset evolves with cosmic time; whether it differs in different cosmologies; whether its origin can be confidently identified; and whether it can be corrected. We found that the offset does evolve slightly with redshift, and that it correlates strongly with the deviation from spherical symmetry of the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halo distribution inside and outside of the turnaround radius. We used an appropriate metric to quantify deviations in the environment of a structure from spherical symmetry. We found that using this metric, we can construct a sphericity-selected sample of halos for which the offset of $ρ_{ta}$ from the spherical collapse prediction is zero, independently of redshift and cosmology. We found that a sphericity-selected halo sample allows us to recover the simulated cosmology, and we conclude that the turnaround density evolution indeed encodes the cosmology in N-body simulations.\n",
      "24        We present a new suite of over 1,500 cosmological N-body simulations with varied Warm <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">Dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">Matter</span> (WDM) models ranging from 2.5 to 30 keV. We use these simulations to train Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to infer WDM particle masses from images of DM field data. Our fiducial setup can make accurate predictions of the WDM particle mass up to 7.5 keV at a 95% confidence level from small maps that cover an area of (25 h$^{-1}$ Mpc)$^2$. We vary the image resolution, simulation resolution, redshift, and cosmology of our fiducial setup to better understand how our model is making predictions. Using these variations, we find that our models are most dependent on simulation resolution, minimally dependent on image resolution, not systematically dependent on redshift, and robust to varied cosmologies. We also find that an important feature to distinguish between WDM models is present with a linear size between 100 and 200 h$^{-1}$ kpc. We compare our fiducial model to one trained on the power spectrum alone and find that our field-level model can make 2x more precise predictions and can make accurate predictions to 2x as massive WDM particle masses when used on the same data. Overall, we find that the field-level data can be used to accurately differentiate between WDM models and contain more information than is captured by the power spectrum. This technique can be extended to more complex DM models and opens up new opportunities to explore alternative DM models in a cosmological environment.\n",
      "25        The properties of globular clusters (GCs) contain valuable information of their host galaxies and <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span>-<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halos. In the remarkable example of ultra-diffuse galaxy, NGC5846-UDG1, the GC population exhibits strong radial mass segregation, indicative of dynamical-friction-driven orbital decay, which opens the possibility of using imaging data alone to constrain the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span>-<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> content of the galaxy. To explore this possibility, we develop a semi-analytical model of GC evolution, which starts from the initial mass function, the initial structure-mass relation, and the initial spatial distribution of the GC progenitors, and follows the effects of dynamical friction, tidal evolution, and two-body relaxation. Using Markov Chain Monte Carlo, we forward-model the GCs in a NGC5846-UDG1-like potential to match the observed GC mass, size, and spatial distributions, and to constrain the profile of the host halo and the origin of the GCs. We find that, with the assumptions of zero mass segregation when the star clusters were born, NGC5846-UDG1 is <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span>-<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> poor compared to what is expected from stellar-to-halo-mass relations, and its halo concentration is low, irrespective of having a cuspy or a cored halo profile. Its GC population has an initial spatial distribution more extended than the smooth stellar distribution. We discuss the results in the context of scaling laws of galaxy-halo connections, and warn against naively using the GC-abundance-halo-mass relation to infer the halo mass of UDGs. Our model is generally applicable to GC-rich dwarf galaxies, and is publicly available at https://github.com/JiangFangzhou/GCevo.\n",
      "26        The Epoch of Reionization (EoR) neutral Hydrogen (HI) 21-cm signal evolves significantly along the line-of-sight (LoS) due to the light-cone (LC) effect. It is important to accurately incorporate this in simulations in order to correctly interpret the signal. 21-cm LC simulations are typically produced by stitching together slices from a finite number $(N_{\\rm RS})$ of &#39;&#39;reionization snapshot&#39;&#39;, each corresponding to a different stage of reionization. In this paper, we have quantified the errors in the 21-cm LC simulation due to the finite value of $N_{\\rm RS}$. We show that this can introduce large discontinuities $(&gt; 200 \\%)$ at the stitching boundaries when $N_{\\rm RS}$ is small $(= 2,4)$ and the mean neutral fraction jumps by $δ\\bar{x}_{\\rm HI} = 0.2,0.1$ respectively at the stitching boundaries. This drops to $17 \\%$ for $N_{\\rm RS} = 13$ where $δ\\bar{x}_{\\rm HI}=0.02$. We present and also validate a method for mitigating this error by increasing $N_{\\rm RS}$ without a proportional increase in the computational costs which are mainly incurred in generating the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> and halo density fields. Our method generates these fields only at a few redshifts, and interpolates them to generate reionization snapshots at closely spaced redshifts. We use this to generate 21-cm LC simulations with $N_{\\rm RS} = 26,51,101$ and $201$, and show that the errors go down as $N_{\\rm RS}^{-1}$.\n",
      "27        The advent of gravitational wave astronomy has seen a huge influx of new predictions for potential discoveries of beyond the Standard Model fields.

The <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> photon is predicted to generate instabilities in a rotating black hole spacetime, birthing a macroscopic Bose-Einstein condensate.

This study builds a preliminary model for the gravitational waveform emitted by such a dressed extreme mass-ratio inspiral. Comparing these waveforms to the vacuum scenario allows projections to the potential constrainability on the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> photon mass by space-borne gravitational wave antennas. The superradiant instability of a massive vector field on a Kerr background is calculated and the modification to the dynamics of an inspiralling solar mass-scale compact object is determined with approximations on the backreaction effect of the cloud on the compact object.

Here we investigate the possibility of alleviating the tension by incorporating uncertainties from three sources in counting massive galaxies at high $z$: cosmic variance, error in stellar mass estimate, and contribution by backsplash. We find that each of the sources can significantly increase the cumulative stellar mass density $ρ_*(&gt;M_*)$ at the high-mass end, and the combination of them can boost the density by more than one order of magnitude. Assuming a star formation efficiency of $ε_* \\sim 0.5$, cosmic variance alone can reduce the tension to $2σ$ level, except the most massive galaxy at $z=8$. Including in addition a lognormal dispersion with a width of 0.3 dex in the stellar mass can bring the observed stellar mass density at $z \\sim 7 - 10$ to the $2σ$ range of the cosmic variance. The tension is completely eliminated when gas stripped from backsplash halos is also taken into account. Our results highlight the importance of fully modeling uncertainties when interpreting observational data of rare objects. We use the constrained simulation, ELUCID, to investigate the descendants of high $z$ massive galaxies. We find that a significant portion of these galaxies end up in massive halos with mass $M_{\\rm halo} &gt; 10^{13} h^{-1}M_\\odot $ at $z=0$. A large fraction of central galaxies in $M_{\\rm halo} \\geqslant 10^{14.5} h^{-1}M_\\odot$ halos today are predicted to contain significant amounts of ancient stars formed in massive galaxies at $z\\sim 8$. This prediction can be tested by studying the structure and stellar population of central galaxies in present-day massive clusters.\n",
      "29        Within the $Λ$CDM cosmology, <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> haloes are comprised of both a smooth component and a population of smaller, gravitationally bound subhaloes. These components are often treated as a single halo when halo properties, such as density profiles, are extracted from simulations. Recent work has shown that density profiles change substantially when subhalo mass is excluded. In this paper, we expand on this result by analysing the change in three specific host halo properties -- concentration ($c_{\\rm{NFW}}$), spin ($λ_{\\rm Bullock}$), and shape ($c/a$), -- when calculated only from the smooth component of the halo. This analysis is performed on both Milky Way-mass haloes and cluster-mass haloes in high-resolution, zoom-in, $N$-body simulations. We find that when subhaloes are excluded the median value of (1) $c_{\\rm{NFW}}$ is enhanced by $\\approx 38 \\pm 12\\%$ and $\\approx 88 \\pm 7.7\\%$ for Milky Way mass ($10^{12.1}\\,\\text{M}_\\odot$) and cluster mass ($10^{14.8}\\,\\text{M}_\\odot$) haloes respectively, (2) $λ_{\\rm Bullock}$ is reduced for Milky Way mass by $\\approx 16 \\pm 6.8\\%$ and cluster mass haloes by $\\approx 32 \\pm 8.9\\%$. Additionally, with the removal of subhaloes, cluster mass haloes tend to become more spherical as the ratio of minor-to-major axis, $c/a$, increases by $\\approx 12 \\pm 4\\%$, whereas Milky Way mass haloes remain approximately the same shape with $c/a$ changed by $\\approx 1.2 \\pm 5.6\\%$. The fractional change of each of these properties depends primarily on the amount of mass that is removed from the halo system and, to a lesser extent, mass accretion history. Our findings demonstrate that the properties of the smooth components of <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> haloes are biased relative to the total mass of the halo including subhaloes.\n",
      "30        In order to test active galactic nucleus (AGN) unification and evolutionary models, we measured the AGN clustering properties as a function of AGN obscuration defined in terms of hydrogen column density, $N_{\\rm H}$. In addition to measuring the clustering of unobscured ($N_{\\rm H} &lt; 10^{22}\\,{\\rm cm}^{-2}$) and moderately obscured ($10^{22} \\leq N_{\\rm H} &lt; 10^{23.5}$) AGNs, we also targeted highly obscured sources ($N_{\\rm H}\\geq 10^{23.5}$) up to redshifts of $z=3$. We have compiled one of the largest samples of X-ray-selected AGNs from a total of eight deep XMM/Chandra surveys. We measured the clustering as a function of both AGN obscuration and redshift using the projected two-point correlation function, $w_{\\rm p}(r_{\\rm p})$. We modeled the large-scale clustering signal, measured the AGN bias, $b(z, N_{\\rm H})$, and interpreted it in terms of the typical AGN host <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halo, $M_{\\rm halo}(z, N_{\\rm H}$). We find no significant dependence of AGN clustering on obscuration, suggesting similar typical masses of the hosting halos as a function of $N_{\\rm H}$. This result matches expectations of AGN unification models, in which AGN obscuration depends mainly on the viewing angle of the obscuring torus. We measured, for the first time, the clustering of highly obscured AGNs and find that these objects reside in halos with typical mass $\\log M_{\\rm halo} = 12.98_{-0.22}^{+0.17} [h^{-1} M_\\odot]$ ($12.28_{-0.19}^{+0.13}$) at low $z \\sim 0.7$ (high $z \\sim 1.8$) redshifts. We find that irrespective of obscuration, an increase in AGN bias with redshift is slower than the expectation for a constant halo mass and instead follows the growth rate of halos, known as the passive evolution track. This implies that for those AGNs the clustering is mainly driven by the mass growth rate of the hosting halos and galaxies across cosmic time.\n",
      "31        Mergers between galaxy clusters are an important stage in the formation of the large-scale structure of the Universe. Some of the mergers show a spectacular bow shock that formed as a result of recent passage of a smaller cluster through a bigger one, the classic example of this being the so-called bullet cluster. In this paper, I describe ten examples of interacting clusters identified among 200 of the most massive objects, with total masses above $1.4 \\times 10^{14}$ M$_{\\odot}$, from the IllustrisTNG300 simulation by searching for prominent bow shocks in their temperature maps. Despite different mass ratios of the two merging clusters, the events are remarkably similar in many respects. In all cases, the companion cluster passed close to the main one only once, between 0.9 and 0.3 Gyr ago, with the pericenter distance of 100-530 kpc and a velocity of up to 3400 km s$^{-1}$. The subcluster, typically an order of magnitude smaller in mass than the main cluster before the interaction, loses most of its <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> and gas in the process. The displacement between the collisionless part of the remnant and the bow shock is such that the remnant typically lags behind the shock or coincides with it, with a single exception of the merger occurring with the largest velocity. Usually about 1% of the gas cells in the merging clusters are shocked, and the median Mach numbers of these gas cells are around two. Due to the relatively small size of the simulation box, no close analog of the bullet cluster was found, but I identified one case that is similar in terms of mass, velocity, and displacement. The presented cases bear more resemblance to less extreme observed interacting clusters such as A520 and Coma.\n",
      "32        Microscopic horizonless relics could form in the early universe either directly through gravitational collapse or as stable remnants of the Hawking evaporation of primordial black holes. In both cases they completely or partially evade cosmological constraints arising from Hawking evaporation and in certain mass ranges can explain the entirety of the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>. We systematically explore the stochastic gravitational-wave background associated with the formation of microscopic <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span>-<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> relics in various scenarios, adopting an agnostic approach and discussing the limitations introduced by existing constraints, possible ways to circumvent the latter, and expected astrophysical foregrounds. Interestingly, this signal is at most marginally detectable with current interferometers but could be detectable by third-generations instruments such as the Einstein Telescope, strengthening their potential as discovery machines.\n",
      "33        In direct <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> (DM) detection via scattering off the electrons, the momentum transfer plays a crucial role. Previous work showed that for self-interacting DM, if the DM particle has a size (the so-called puffy DM), the radius effect could dominate the momentum transfer and become another source of velocity dependence for self-scattering cross section. In this work we investigate the direct detection of puffy DM particles with different radii through electron recoil. We find that comparing with the available experimental exclusion limits dominated by the mediator effect for XENON10, XENON100 and XENON1T, the constraints on the puffy DM-electron scattering cross-section become much weaker for large radius DM particles. For small-radius DM particles, the constraints remain similar to the point-like DM case.\n",
      "34        Boson stars are gravitationally bound objects that arise in ultralight <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> models and form in the centers of galactic halos or axion miniclusters. We systematically study the excitations of a boson star, taking into account the mixing between positive and negative frequencies introduced by gravity. We show that the spectrum contains zero-energy modes in the monopole and dipole sectors resulting from spontaneous symmetry breaking by the boson star background. We analyze the general properties of the eigenmodes and derive their orthogonality and completeness conditions which have non-standard form due to the positive-negative frequency mixing. The eigenvalue problem is solved numerically for the first few energy levels in different multipole sectors and the results are compared to the solutions of the Schrödinger equation in fixed boson star gravitational potential. The two solutions differ significantly for the lowest modes, but get close for higher levels. We further confirm the normal mode spectrum in 3D wave simulations where we inject perturbations with different multipoles. As an application of the normal mode solutions, we compute the matrix element entering the evaporation rate of a boson star immersed in a hot axion gas. The computation combines the use of exact wavefunctions for the low-lying bound states and of the Schrödinger approximation for the high-energy excitations.\n",
      "35        If long-range attractive forces exist and are stronger than gravity then cosmic halo formation can begin in the radiation-dominated era. We study a simple realization of this effect in a system where <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> fermions have Yukawa interactions mediated by scalar particles, analogous to the Higgs boson in the standard model. We develop a self-consistent description of the system including exact background dynamics of the scalar field, and precise modelling of the fermion density fluctuations. For the latter, we provide accurate approximations for the linear growth as well as quantitative modelling of the nonlinear evolution using N-body simulations. We find that halo formation occurs exponentially fast and on scales substantially larger than simple estimates predict. The final fate of these halos remains uncertain, but could be annihilation, <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> stars, primordial black holes, or even the existence of galaxy-sized halos at <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>-radiation equality. More generally, our results demonstrate the importance of mapping scalar-mediated interactions onto structure formation outcomes and constraints for beyond the standard model theories.\n",
      "36        Recent analysis on the stellar kinematics of ultra-faint dwarf (UFD) galaxies has put a stringent upper limit on the self-scattering cross section of <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>, i.e., $σ/m&lt;{\\cal O}(0.1)\\,{\\rm cm^2/g}$ at the scattering velocity of ${\\cal O}(10)\\,{\\rm km/s}$. Resonant self-interacting <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> (rSIDM) is one possibility that can be consistent with the UFDs and explain the low central densities of rotation-supported galaxies; the cross section is resonantly enhanced to be $σ/m = {\\cal O}(1)\\,{\\rm cm^2/g}$ around the scattering velocity of ${\\cal O}(100)\\,{\\rm km/s}$ while being suppressed at lower velocities. To further assess this possibility, since the inferred <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> distribution of halos from astrophysical observations is usually compared to that in constant-cross section SIDM (cSIDM), whether the structures of rSIDM halos can be approximated by the cSIDM halo profiles needs to be clarified. In this work, we employ the grovothermal fluid method to investigate the structural evolution of rSIDM halos in a wide mass range. We find that except for halos in a specific mass range, the present structures of rSIDM halos are virtually indistinguishable from those of the cSIDM halos. For halos in the specific mass range, the resonant self-scattering renders a break in their density profile. We demonstrate how such a density-profile break appears in astrophysical observations, e.g., rotation curves and line-of-sight velocity dispersion profiles. We show that for halos above the specific mass range, the density-profile break thermalizes to disappear before the present. We demonstrate that such distinctive thermalization dynamics can leave imprints on the orbital classes of stars with similar ages and metallicities.\n",
      "37        The E-type $α$-attractor models of single-field inflation were generalized further in order to accommodate production of primordial black holes (PBH) via adding a near-inflection point to the inflaton scalar potential at smaller scales, in good agreement with measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation. A minimal number of new parameters was used but their fine-tuning was maximized in order to increase possible masses of PBH formed during an ultra-slow-roll phase leading to a large enhancement of the power spectrum of scalar (curvature) perturbations by 6 or 7 orders of magnitude against the power spectrum of perturbations observed in CMB. It was found that extreme fine-tuning of the parameters in our models can lead to a formation of the Earth-size PBH with the masses of approximately $10^{27}$ g, still in agreement with CMB observations. Quantum corrections are known to lead to the perturbative upper bound on the amplitude of large scalar perturbations responsible for PBH production. The quantum (one-loop) corrections in our models were found to be suppressed by one order of magnitude for PBH with the masses of approximately $10^{19}$ g, which may form the whole <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> in the Universe.\n",
      "38        We discuss in detail the possibility that the &#34;type-II majoron&#34; -- that is, the pseudo Nambu-Goldstone boson that arises in the context of the type-II seesaw mechanism if the lepton number is spontaneously broken by an additional singlet scalar -- account for the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> (DM) observed in the universe. We study the requirements the model&#39;s parameters have to fulfill in order to reproduce the measured DM relic abundance through two possible production mechanisms in the early universe, freeze-in and misalignment, both during a standard radiation-dominated era and early <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> domination. We then study possible signals of type-II majoron DM and the present and expected constraints on the parameter space that can be obtained from cosmological observations, direct detection experiments, and present and future searches for decaying DM at neutrino telescopes and cosmic-ray experiments. We find that -- depending on the majoron mass, the production mechanism, and the value of the vacuum expectation value of the type-II triplet -- all of the three decay modes (photons, electrons, neutrinos) of majoron DM particles can yield observable signals at future indirect searches for DM. Furthermore, in a corner of the parameter space, detection of majoron DM is possible through electron recoil at running and future direct detection experiments.\n",
      "39        Running vacuum models and viscous <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> scenarios beyond perfect fluid idealization are two appealing theoretical strategies that have been separately studied as alternatives to solve some problems rooted in the $Λ$CDM cosmological model. In this paper, we combine these two notions in a single cosmological setting and investigate their cosmological implications, paying particular attention in the interplay between these two constituents in different cosmological periods. Specifically, we consider a well-studied running vacuum model inspired by renormalization group, and a recently proposed general parameterization for the bulk viscosity $ξ$. By employing dynamical system analysis, we explore the physical aspects of the new phase space that emerges from the combined models and derive stability conditions that ensure complete cosmological dynamics. We identify four distinct classes of models and find that the critical points of the phase space are non-trivially renewed compared to the single scenarios. We then proceed, in a joint and complementary way to the dynamical system analysis, with a detailed numerical exploration to quantify the impact of both the running parameter and the bulk viscosity coefficient on the cosmological evolution. Thus, for some values of the model parameters, numerical solutions show qualitative differences from the $Λ$CDM model, which is phenomenologically appealing in light of cosmological observations.\n",
      "40        The intrinsic alignment (IA) of observed galaxy shapes with the underlying cosmic web is a source of contamination in weak lensing surveys. Sensitive methods to identify the IA signal will therefore need to be included in the upcoming weak lensing analysis pipelines. Hydrodynamical cosmological simulations allow us to directly measure the intrinsic ellipticities of galaxies and thus provide a powerful approach to predict and understand the IA signal. Here we employ the novel, large-volume hydrodynamical simulation MTNG740, a product of the MillenniumTNG (MTNG) project, to study the IA of galaxies. We measure the projected correlation functions between the intrinsic shape/shear of galaxies and various tracers of large-scale structure, $w_{+g},\\ w_{+m},\\ w_{++}$ over the radial range $r_{\\rm p} \\in [0.02 , 200]\\,h^{-1}{\\rm Mpc}$ and at redshifts $z=0.0$, $0.5$ and $1.0$. We detect significant signal-to-noise IA signals with the density field for both elliptical and spiral galaxies. We also find significant intrinsic shear-shear correlations for ellipticals. We further examine correlations of the intrinsic shape of galaxies with the local tidal field. Here we find a significant IA signal for elliptical galaxies assuming a linear model. We also detect a weak IA signal for spiral galaxies under a quadratic tidal torquing model. Lastly, we measure the alignment between central galaxies and their host <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span>-<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halos, finding small to moderate misalignments between their principal axes that decline with halo mass.\n",
      "41        We study weak gravitational lensing convergence maps produced from the MillenniumTNG (MTNG) simulations by direct projection of the mass distribution on the past backwards lightcone of a fiducial observer. We explore the lensing maps over a large dynamic range in simulation mass and angular resolution, allowing us to establish a clear assessment of numerical convergence. By comparing full physics hydrodynamical simulations with corresponding <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span>-<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>-only runs we quantify the impact of baryonic physics on the most important weak lensing statistics. Likewise, we predict the impact of massive neutrinos reliably far into the non-linear regime. We also demonstrate that the &#34;fixed &amp; paired&#34; variance suppression technique increases the statistical robustness of the simulation predictions on large scales not only for time slices but also for continuously output lightcone data. We find that both baryonic and neutrino effects substantially impact weak lensing shear measurements, with the latter dominating over the former on large angular scales. Thus, both effects must explicitly be included to obtain sufficiently accurate predictions for stage IV lensing surveys. Reassuringly, our results agree accurately with other simulation results where available, supporting the promise of simulation modelling for precision cosmology far into the non-linear regime.\n",
      "42        An era of kination occurs when the Universe&#39;s energy density is dominated by a fast-rolling scalar field. <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">Dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> that is thermally produced during an era of kination requires larger-than-canonical annihilation cross sections to generate the observed <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> relic abundance. Furthermore, <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> density perturbations that enter the horizon during an era of kination grow linearly with the scale factor prior to radiation domination. We show how the resulting enhancement to the small-scale <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> power spectrum increases the microhalo abundance and boosts the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> annihilation rate. We then use gamma-ray observations to constrain thermal <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> production during kination. The annihilation boost factor depends on the minimum halo mass, which is determined by the small-scale cutoff in the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> power spectrum. Therefore, observational limits on the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> annihilation rate imply a minimum cutoff scale for a given <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> particle mass and kination scenario. For <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> that was once in thermal equilibrium with the Standard Model, this constraint establishes a maximum allowed kinetic decoupling temperature for the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>. This bound on the decoupling temperature implies that the growth of perturbations during kination cannot appreciably boost the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> annihilation rate if <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> was once in thermal equilibrium with the Standard Model.\n",
      "43        We present the measurement of total and stellar/<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> decomposed mass density profile around a sample of galaxy groups and clusters with dynamical masses derived from integral-field stellar kinematics from the MaNGA survey in Paper~I and weak lensing derived from the DECaLS imaging survey. Combining the two data sets enables accurate measurement of the radial density distribution from several kpc to Mpc scales. Intriguingly, we find that the excess surface density derived from stellar kinematics in the inner region cannot be explained by simply adding an NFW <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halo extrapolated from lensing measurement at a larger scale to a stellar mass component derived from the NASA-Sloan Atlas (NSA) catalog. We find that a good fit to both data sets requires a stellar mass normalization about 3 times higher than that derived from the NSA catalog, which would require an unrealistically too-heavy initial mass function for stellar mass estimation. If we keep the stellar mass normalization to that of the NSA catalog but allow a varying inner <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> density profile, we obtain an asymptotic slope of $γ_{\\rm gnfw}$= $1.82_{-0.25}^{+0.15}$, $γ_{\\rm gnfw}$= $1.48_{-0.41}^{+0.20}$ for the group bin and the cluster bin respectively, significantly steeper than the NFW case. We also compare the total mass inner density slopes with those from Illustris-TNG300 and find that the values from the simulation are lower than the observation by at least $3σ$ level.\n",
      "44        We present dynamical scaling relations, combined with the stellar population properties, for a subsample of about 6000 nearby galaxies with the most reliable dynamical models extracted from the full MaNGA sample of 10K galaxies. We show that the inclination-corrected mass plane (MP) for both early-type galaxies (ETGs) and late-type galaxies (LTGs), which links dynamical mass, projected half-light radius $R_{\\rm e}$, and the second stellar velocity moment $σ_{\\rm e}$ within $R_{\\rm e}$, satisfies the virial theorem and is even tighter than the uncorrected one. We find a clear parabolic relation between $\\lg(M/L)(&lt;R_{\\rm e})$, the total mass-to-light ratio within a sphere of radius $R_{\\rm e}$, and $\\lgσ_{\\rm e}$, with the $M/L$ increasing with $σ_{\\rm e}$ and for older stellar populations. However, the relation for ETGs is linear and the one for the youngest galaxies is constant. We confirm and improve the relation between average logarithmic total density slopes $γ_{_{\\rm T}}$ and $σ_{\\rm e}$: $γ_{_{\\rm T}}$ become steeper with increasing $σ_{\\rm e}$ until $\\lg(σ_{\\rm e}/{\\rm km\\,s^{-1}})\\approx 2.2$ and then remain constant around $γ_{_{\\rm T}}\\approx -2.2$. The $γ_{_{\\rm T}}-σ_{\\rm e}$ variation is larger for LTGs than ETGs. At fixed $σ_{\\rm e}$ the total density profiles steepen with galaxy age and for ETGs. We find generally low <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> fractions, median $f_{\\rm DM}(&lt;R_{\\rm e})=8$ per cent, within a sphere of radius $R_{\\rm e}$.

The increased $f_{\\rm DM}(&lt;R_{\\rm e})$ at low $σ_{\\rm e}$ explains the parabolic $\\lg(M/L)(&lt;R_{\\rm e})-\\lgσ_{\\rm e}$ relation.\n",
      "45        We analyze the global stellar population, radial gradients and non-parametric star formation history of $\\sim 10$K galaxies from the MaNGA Survey final data release 17 (DR17), based on stellar population synthesis and full-spectrum fitting, and relate them with dynamical properties of galaxies. We confirm that stellar population correlates with stellar velocity dispersion $σ_{\\rm e}$ better than with stellar mass $M_{\\ast}$, but also find that younger galaxies are more metal-poor at fixed $σ_{\\rm e}$. Stellar age, metallicity, and mass-to-light ratio $M_{\\ast}/L$ all decrease with galaxy rotation, while radial gradients become more negative (i.e., younger, more metal-poor, and lower $M_{\\ast}/L$ in the outskirts). The trend between metallicity gradients and rotation reverses for slow rotators, which stand out for their more negative metallicity gradients than faster-rotating galaxies. We highlight a population of massive disk galaxies on the green valley, on the $(σ_{\\rm e},\\rm Age)$ plane, that show steep negative age and metallicity gradients, consistent with their old central bulges surrounded by young star-forming disks and metal-poor gas accretion. Galaxies with high $σ_{\\rm e}$, steep total mass-density slope, low <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> fraction, high $M_{\\ast}/L$, and high metallicity have the highest star-formation rate at earlier times, and are currently quenched.

      "46        This is the first paper in our series on the combined analysis of the Dynamics and stellar Population (DynPop) for the MaNGA survey in the final SDSS Data Release 17 (DR17). Here we present a catalogue of dynamically-determined quantities for over 10000 nearby galaxies based on integral-field stellar kinematics from the MaNGA survey. The dynamical properties are extracted using the axisymmetric Jeans Anisotropic Modelling (JAM) method, which was previously shown to be the most accurate for this kind of study. We assess systematic uncertainties using eight dynamical models with different assumptions. We use two orientations of the velocity ellipsoid: either cylindrically-aligned JAM$_{\\rm cyl}$ or spherically-aligned JAM$_{\\rm sph}$. We also make four assumptions for the models&#39; <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> vs. luminous <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> distributions: (1) mass-follows-light, (2) free NFW <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> halo, (3) cosmologically-constrained NFW halo, (4) generalized NFW <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> halo, i.e. with free inner slope. In this catalogue, we provide the quantities related to the mass distributions (e.g. the density slopes and enclosed mass within a sphere of a given radius for total mass, stellar mass, and <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> mass components). We also provide the complete models which can be used to compute the full luminous and mass distribution of each galaxy. Additionally, we visually assess the qualities of the models to help with model selections. We estimate the observed scatter in the measured quantities which decreases as expected with improvements in quality. For the best data quality, we find a remarkable consistency of measured quantities between different models, highlighting the robustness of the results.\n",
      "47        What is the highest energy at which gravitons can be observed? We address this question by studying graviton-to-photon conversion - the inverse-Gertsenshtein effect - in the magnetic field of the Milky Way. We find that above $\\sim 1~\\mbox{PeV}$ the effective photon mass grows large enough to quench the conversion rate. The induced photon flux is comparable to the sensitivity of LHAASO to a diffuse $γ$-ray background, but only for graviton abundances of order $Ω_{\\text{gw}} h^2_0 \\sim 1$. In the future, owing to a better understanding of $γ$-ray backgrounds, larger effective areas and longer observation times, sub-PeV shimmering gravitons with a realistic abundance of $Ω_{\\text{gw}} h^2_0 \\sim 0.01$ could be detected. We show that this is achieved in a cosmologically-motivated scenario of post-recombination superheavy <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> decay. Therefore, the sub-PeV range might be the ultimate energy frontier at which gravitons can be observed.\n",

However, the high-mass end of this relation is not well determined from previous data and shows large scatter. We analyze the globular cluster systems (GCSs) of a homogeneous sample of 11 brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) through DOLPHOT photometry of their deep Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images in the F814W filter. We standardize the definition of $M_{GCS}$, the total GCS mass, by using the GC total population within a limiting radius of $0.1 R_{virial}$, while the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span>-<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halo mass $M_h$ is determined from the weak-lensing calibration of $M_h$ versus $M_{bary}$. When these 11 BCGs are added to the previously studied homogeneous catalogue of Virgo member galaxies, a total value for $η= M_{GCS}/M_h$ is found to be $(3.0\\pm1.8_{internal})\\times10^{-5}$, slightly higher than previous estimates but with much reduced uncertainty. Perhaps more importantly, the results suggest that the relation continues to have a near-linear shape at the highest galaxy masses, strongly reinforcing the conclusion that accreted GCs make a major contribution to the GC populations at high galaxy mass.\n",
      "49        We introduce an analytic surface density profile for <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halos that accurately reproduces the structure of simulated halos of mass $M_{\\rm vir} = 10^{7-11}\\ M_\\odot$, making it useful for modeling line-of-sight perturbers in strong gravitational lensing models. The two-parameter function has an analytic deflection potential and is more accurate than the projected Navarro, Frenk &amp; White (NFW) profile commonly adopted at this mass scale for perturbers, especially at the small radii of most relevant for lensing perturbations. Using a characteristic radius, $R_{-1}$, where the log slope of surface density is equal to $-1$, and an associated surface density, $Σ_{-1}$, we can represent the expected lensing signal from line-of-sight halos statistically, for an ensemble of halo orientations, using a distribution of {\\em projected concentration} parameters, $\\mathcal{C}_{\\rm vir} := r_{\\rm vir}/ R_{-1}$. Though an individual halo can have a projected concentration that varies with orientation with respect to the observer, the range of projected concentrations correlates with the usual three-dimensional halo concentration in a way that enables ease of use.\n",
      "50        Axions and axion-like particles (ALPs) are a prominent <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> candidate, drawing motivation in part from the axiverse of string theory. Axion-like particles can also arise as composite degrees of freedom of a <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> sector, for example, as <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> pions in <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> Quantum Chromo-Dynamics. In a <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> Standard Model (SM) wherein all 6 quark flavors are light while the photon is massive, one finds a rich low-energy spectrum of stable and ultralight particles, in the form of neutral and charged <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> scalars, and complex neutral scalars analogous to the SM kaon, with mass splittings determined by the mass and charge of the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> quarks. The model finds a natural portal to the visible sector via kinetic coupling of the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> and visible photons, and consequent millicharges for <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>. The <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> can be a mixture of all these ultralight bosonic degrees of freedom, and exhibit both parity-even and parity-odd interactions, making the theory testable at a wide variety of experiments. In context of <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> QCD with $N_f$ flavors of light quarks, this scenario predicts $N_f^2-1$ ultralight axion-like particles -- effectively an axiverse from <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> QCD.

      "51        The most luminous quasars at $z &gt; 6$ are suspected to be both highly clustered and reside in the most massive <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halos in the early Universe, making them prime targets to search for galaxy overdensities and/or protoclusters. We search for Lyman-break dropout-selected galaxies using HST WFC3/ACS broadband imaging in the fields of three $6 &lt; z &lt; 7$ quasars, as well as their simultaneously observed coordinated-parallel fields, and constrain their photometric redshifts using EAZY. One field, J0305-3150, shows a volume density 10$\\times$ higher than the blank-field UV luminosity function (UVLF) at M$_{UV} &lt; -20$, with tentative evidence of a 3$σ$ overdensity in its parallel field located 15 cMpc away. Another field, J2054-0005, shows an angular overdensity within 500 ckpc from the quasar but still consistent with UVLF predictions within 3$σ$, while the last field, J2348-3054, shows no enhancement. We discuss methods for reducing uncertainty in overdensity measurements when using photometric selection and show that we can robustly select LBGs consistent with being physically associated with the quasar, corroborated by existing JWST/NIRCam WFSS data in the J0305 field. Even accounting for incompleteness, the overdensities in J0305 and J2054 are higher for brighter galaxies at short angular separations, suggesting preferential enhancement of more massive galaxies in the immediate vicinity of the quasar. Finally, we compare the LBG population with previously-identified [CII] and mm-continuum companions; the LBG overdensities are not accompanied by an enhanced number of dusty galaxies, suggesting that the overdense quasar fields are not in the bursty star-forming phase sometimes seen in high-redshift protoclusters.\n"

      "2        This thesis explores the effects of <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> (DM) on neutron stars (NSs) using the relativistic mean-field (RMF) model. The effects of DM on NS properties, including the mass-radius relation, the moment of inertia, and tidal deformability, are calculated by varying its fraction. The study found that the EOS becomes softer with increasing DM momentum, and the DM has marginal effects on nuclear <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> properties, except for the EOSs and binding energy per particle. The study also calculated the properties of isolated, static, and rotating DM admixed NS and found that the DM has significant effects on both static and rotating NS. We have also observed that a tiny amount of DM can accumulate inside the NS, and more amount of it makes the NS unstable. The study also suggests that the secondary component might be a NS with DM content if the underlying nuclear EOS is sufficiently stiff. The $f$-mode oscillations of the DM admixed hyperon stars are calculated and found that there exist a correlation between canonical $f$-mode frequency and the dimensionless tidal deformability parameter ($Λ_{1.4}$) and we have put a constraint on $f$-mode frequency using GW170817 data. Finally, we have calculated the DM admixed binary NS properties and found that the binary system becomes less deformed and sustains more time in its inspiral phases with the addition of DM. Therefore, we suggest that one can take DM inside the compact objects while modeling the inspiral waveforms for the BNS systems.\n",
      "3        Radiative emissions from electrons and positrons generated by <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> (DM) annihilation or decay are one of the most investigated signals in indirect searches of WIMPs. Ideal targets must have large ratio of DM to baryonic <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>. However, such ``<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span>&#39;&#39; systems have a poorly known level of magnetic turbulence, which determines the residence time of the electrons and positrons and therefore also the strength of the expected signal. This typically leads to significant uncertainties in the derived DM bounds. In a novel approach, we compute the self-confinement of the DM-induced electrons and positrons. Indeed, they themselves generate irregularities in the magnetic field, thus setting a lower limit on the presence of the magnetic turbulence. We specifically apply this approach to dwarf spheroidal galaxies. Finally, by comparing the expected synchrotron emission with radio data from the direction of the Draco galaxy collected at the Giant Metre Radio Telescope, we show that the proposed approach can be used to set robust and competitive bounds on WIMP DM.\n",
      "4        The particle origin of <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> (DM) is still one of the main puzzles in modern physics. One of the most promising search strategy to detect DM at laboratories is through the indirect search of cosmic particles that are produced from DM annihilation in space. In particular, the flux of cosmic positrons has been measured with high precision by the AMS-02 experiment demonstrating that an excess above 10 GeV, with respect to the secondary production, is present. We study in this paper the possible DM origin of the positron excess finding the values of the DM mass $M$ and annihilation cross section $\\langle σv \\rangle$ that are needed to fit high-energy positron data. In particular, we find that for DM annihilating into $b\\bar{b}$ it is required to have $M=43$ TeV and $\\langle σv \\rangle = 10^{-21}$ cm$^3$/s while for $τ^+τ^-$ $M=2$ TeV and $\\langle σv \\rangle = 3\\times 10^{-23}$ cm$^3$/s. If DM produce positrons, they are expected to generate gamma rays from the center of the Milky Way and around dwarf galaxy satellites of the Galaxy. We thus combine the values for the DM mass and annihilation cross section obtained with the fit to AMS-02 positron data with the upper limits derived with the non-detection of $γ$ rays with HESS in the direction of the Galactic center and Fermi-LAT for the combined analysis of dwarf galaxies. The main result of the paper is that only DM annihilating into $μ^+ μ^-$ with a mass around 500 GeV and $\\langle σv \\rangle = 4\\times 10^{-24}$ cm$^3$/s can fit AMS-02 data and be compatible with the upper limits found with $γ$ rays. As for the $τ^+ τ^-$ ($b\\bar{b}$) channel, DM can contribute at most at a few tens $\\%$ (a few \\%) level.\n",

We study a semi-analytical subhalo model for interacting <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> with radiation, based on the extended Press-Schechter formalism and subhalos&#39; tidal evolution prescription. We also test the elastic scattering between DM and neutrinos using observations of Milky-Way satellites from the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">Dark</span> Energy Survey and PanSTARRS1. We conservatively impose strong constraints on the DM-neutrino scattering cross section of $σ_{{\\rm DM}\\text{-}ν,n}\\propto E_ν^n$ $(n=0,2,4)$ at $95\\%$ confidence level (CL), $σ_{{\\rm DM}\\text{-}ν,0}&lt; 10^{-32}\\ {\\rm cm^2}\\ (m_{\\rm DM}/{\\rm GeV})$, $σ_{{\\rm DM}\\text{-}ν,2}&lt; 10^{-43}\\ {\\rm cm^2}\\ (m_{\\rm DM}/{\\rm GeV})(E_ν/E_ν^0)^2$ and $σ_{{\\rm DM}\\text{-}ν,4}&lt; 10^{-54}\\ {\\rm cm^2}\\ (m_{\\rm DM}/{\\rm GeV})(E_ν/E_ν^0)^4$, where $E_ν^0$ is the average momentum of relic cosmic neutrinos today, $E_ν^0 \\simeq 3.15 T_ν^0 \\simeq 6.1\\ {\\rm K}$.

      "6        Numerous observations suggest that there exist undiscovered beyond-the-Standard-Model particles and fields. Because of their unknown nature, these exotic particles and fields could interact with Standard Model particles in many different ways and assume a variety of possible configurations. Here we present an overview of the Global Network of Optical Magnetometers for Exotic physics searches (GNOME), our ongoing experimental program designed to test a wide range of exotic physics scenarios. The GNOME experiment utilizes a worldwide network of shielded atomic magnetometers (and, more recently, comagnetometers) to search for spatially and temporally correlated signals due to torques on atomic spins from exotic fields of astrophysical origin. We survey the temporal characteristics of a variety of possible signals currently under investigation such as those from topological defect <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> (axion-like particle domain walls), axion-like particle stars, solitons of complex-valued scalar fields (Q-balls), stochastic fluctuations of bosonic <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> fields, a solar axion-like particle halo, and bursts of ultralight bosonic fields produced by cataclysmic astrophysical events such as binary black hole mergers.\n",
      "7        Recent observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) are yielding tantalizing hints of an early population of massive, bright galaxies at $z &gt; 10$, with Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) observations indicating significant dust masses in place as early as $z\\sim 7$. To understand the implications of these observations, we use the DELPHI semi-analytic model that jointly tracks the assembly of <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halos and their constituent baryons, including the key processes of dust enrichment. Our model employs only two redshift- and mass-independent free parameters that are tuned against all available galaxy data at $z \\sim 5-9$ before it is used to make predictions up to $z \\sim 20$. Our key results are: (1) the model progressively under-predicts the observed ultraviolet luminosity function (UV LF) at $z &gt; 12$; observations at $z&gt;16$ lie close to, or even above, a &#34;maximal&#34; model where all available gas is turned into stars; (2) UV selection would miss 34% of the star formation rate density at $z \\sim 5$, decreasing to 17% by $z \\sim 10$ for bright galaxies with $\\rm{M_{UV}} &lt; -19$; (3) the dust mass ($M_d$) evolves with the stellar mass ($M_*$) and redshift as $\\log(M_d) = 1.194\\log(M_*) + 0.0975z - 5.433$; (4) the escape fraction of UV photons ($f_{\\rm esc}^{\\rm UV}$) decreases with increasing mass and star formation rate. At $z \\sim 7$, $f_{\\rm esc}^{\\rm UV} \\sim 0.8~(0.1)$ for $M_* \\sim 10^9~ (10^{11}) \\, M_\\odot$ galaxies; (5) the dust temperature increases with stellar mass, ranging between $30-33$ K for $M_* \\sim 10^{9-11}M_\\odot$ galaxies at $z \\sim 7$. Finally, we predict the far infrared (FIR) LF at $z \\sim 5-20$, testable with ALMA observations, and caution that spectroscopic redshifts and dust masses must be pinned down before invoking unphysical extrema in galaxy formation models.\n",
      "8        We reexamine the consequences of perturbative unitarity on <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> freeze-out when both Sommerfeld enhancement and bound state formation affect <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> annihilations. At leading order (LO) the annihilation cross-section is infrared dominated and the connection between the unitarity bound and the upper bound on the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> mass depends only on how the different partial waves are populated. We compute how this picture is modified at next-to-leading order (NLO) with the goal of assigning a reliable theory uncertainty to the freeze-out predictions. We explicitly compute NLO corrections in a simple model with abelian gauge interactions and provide an estimate of the theoretical uncertainty for the thermal masses of heavy electroweak $n$-plets. Along the way, we clarify the regularization and matching procedure necessary to deal with singular potentials in quantum mechanics with a calculable relativistic UV completion.\n",
      "9        We provide an algorithm for evolving general spin-$s$ Gross-Pitaevskii / non-linear Schrödinger systems carrying a variety of interactions, where the $2s+1$ components of the `spinor&#39; field represent the different spin-multiplicity states. We consider many nonrelativistic interactions up to quartic order in the Schrödinger field (both short and long-range, and spin-dependent and spin-independent interactions), including explicit spin-orbit couplings. The algorithm allows for spatially varying external and/or self-generated vector potentials that couple to the spin density of the field. Our work can be used for scenarios ranging from laboratory systems such as spinor Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs), to cosmological/astrophysical systems such as self-interacting bosonic <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>. As examples, we provide results for two different setups of spin-$1$ BECs that employ a varying magnetic field and spin-orbit coupling, respectively, and also collisions of spin-$1$ solitons in <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>.

      "10        We discuss the production of primordial black holes in an early <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> dominated era, which typically takes place in string inspired early universe cosmological models. In particular, we consider a pre-big bang scenario (extending previous results regarding formation in the radiation dominated era) where the enhancement of curvature perturbations is induced by a variation of the sound-speed parameter c_s during the string phase of high-curvature inflation. After imposing all relevant observational constraints, we find that the considered class of models is compatible with the production of a large amount of primordial black holes, in the mass range relevant to <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>, only for a small range of the parameters space. On the other hand, we find that a huge production of light primordial black holes may occur both in such <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> dominated era and in the radiation dominated one.\n",
      "11        We explore an extension of the standard $Λ$CDM model by including an interaction between neutrinos and <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>, and making use of the ground based telescope data of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT). An indication for a non-zero coupling between <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> and neutrinos (both assuming a temperature independent and $T^2$ dependent cross-section) is obtained at the 1$σ$ level coming from the ACT CMB data alone and when combined with the Planck CMB and Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) measurements. This result is confirmed by both fixing the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom in the early Universe to the Standard Model value of $N_{\\rm eff}=3.044$, and allowing $N_{\\rm eff}$ to be a free cosmological parameter. Furthermore, when performing a Bayesian model comparison, the interacting $ν$DM (+$N_{\\rm eff}$) scenario is mostly preferred over a baseline $Λ$CDM (+$N_{\\rm eff}$) cosmology. The preferred value is then used as a benchmark and the potential implications of <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter&#39;s</span> interaction with a sterile neutrino are discussed.\n",
      "12        We present an innovative approach to constraining the non-cold <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> model using a convolutional neural network (CNN).

      "13        The <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> power spectrum has been strongly constrained by astronomical measurements at large scales, but only weakly at small scales. Compared with the standard scenario, the deviation of the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> power spectrum at small scales has influence on the cosmological structure formation, e.g., the comoving number density of <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halos. The thermal history of the intergalactic medium (IGM) can be changed if <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> is made of weakly interacting massive particles and can annihilate into standard model particles.

In view of the measurements of the global 21-cm signal by the EDGES experiment, we explore the allowed parameter space of $m_s$, which describes the degree of deviation, by requiring the differential brightness temperature of the global 21-cm signal $δT_{21} \\le -50~\\rm mK$ at redshift $z=17$.\n",
      "14        Using Low Brightness Surface Galaxies (LBSG) rotational curves we inferred the free parameters of $\\ell$-boson stars as a <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> component. The $\\ell$-boson stars are numerical solutions to the non-relativistic limit of the Einstein-Klein-Gordon system, the Schrödinger-Poisson (SP) system. These solutions are parametrized by an angular momentum number $\\ell = (N-1)/2$ and an excitation number $n$. We perform a bayesian analysis by modifying the SimpleMC code to perform the parameter inference, for the cases with $\\ell = 0$, $\\ell = 1$ and multistates of $\\ell$-boson stars. We used the Akaike information criterion (AIC), Bayesian information criterion and the Bayes factor to compare the excited state ($\\ell$=1) and the multistate case with the ground state ($\\ell$=0) as the base model due to its simplicity. We found that the data in most galaxies in the sample favours the multistates case and that the scalar field mass tends to be slightly bigger than the ground state case.\n",
      "15        A long-standing observed curiosity of globular clusters (GCs) has been that both the number and total mass of GCs in a galaxy are linearly correlated with the galaxy&#39;s virial mass, whereas its stellar component shows no such linear correlation. This work expands on an empirical model for the numbers and ages of GCs in galaxies presented by Valenzuela et al. (2021) that is consistent with recent observational data from massive elliptical galaxies down to the dwarf galaxy regime. Applying the model to simulations, GC numbers are shown to be excellent tracers for the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> (DM) virial mass, even when distinct formation mechanisms are employed for blue and red GCs. Furthermore, the amount of DM smooth accretion is encoded in the GC abundances, therefore providing a measure for an otherwise nearly untraceable component of the formation history of galaxies.\n",
      "16        We analytically solve the problem of Bose star growth in the bath of gravitationally interacting particles. We find that after nucleation of this object, the bath is described by a self-similar solution of the kinetic equation, which is an attractor. Together with the conservation laws, this fixes mass evolution of the Bose star. Our results explain slowdown of the star growth at a certain &#34;core-halo&#34; mass, but also predict formation of the heavier and lighter objects in magistral <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> models.\n",
      "17        <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">Dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> subhaloes are key for the predictions of simulations of structure formation, but their existence frequently ends prematurely due to two technical issues, namely numerical disruption in N-body simulations and halo finders failing to identify them. Here we focus on the second issue, using the phase-space friends-of-friends halo finder ROCKSTAR as a benchmark (though we expect our results to translate to comparable codes). We confirm that the most prominent cause for losing track of subhaloes is tidal distortion rather than a low number of particles. As a solution, we present a flexible post-processing algorithm that tracks all subhalo particles over time, computes subhalo positions and masses based on those particles, and progressively removes stripped <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>. If a subhalo is lost by the halo finder, this algorithm keeps tracking its so-called ghost until it has almost no particles left or has truly merged with its host. We apply this technique to a large suite of N-body simulations and restore lost subhaloes to the halo catalogues, which has a dramatic effect on key summary statistics of large-scale structure. Specifically, the subhalo mass function increases by about 50% and the halo correlation function increases by a factor of two at small scales. While these quantitative results are somewhat specific to our algorithm, they demonstrate that particle tracking is a promising way to reliably follow haloes and reduce the need for orphan models. Our algorithm and augmented halo catalogues are publicly available.\n",
      "18        Ultralight bosons are predicted in many extensions to the Standard Model and are popular <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> candidates. The black hole superradiance mechanism allows for these particles to be probed using only their gravitational interaction. In this scenario, an ultralight boson cloud may form spontaneously around a spinning black hole and extract a non-negligible fraction of the black hole&#39;s mass. These oscillating clouds produce quasi-monochromatic, long-duration gravitational waves that may be detectable by ground-based or space-based gravitational wave detectors. We discuss the capability of a new long-duration signal tracking method, based on a hidden Markov model, to detect gravitational wave signals generated by ultralight vector boson clouds, including cases where the signal frequency evolution timescale is much shorter than that of a typical continuous wave signal. We quantify the detection horizon distances for vector boson clouds with current- and next-generation ground-based detectors. We demonstrate that vector clouds hosted by black holes with mass $\\gtrsim 60 M_{\\odot}$ and spin $\\gtrsim 0.6$ are within the reach of current-generation detectors up to a luminosity distance of $\\sim 1$ Gpc. This search method enables one to target vector boson clouds around remnant black holes from compact binary mergers detected by gravitational-wave detectors. We discuss the impact of the sky localization of the merger events and demonstrate that a typical remnant black hole reasonably well-localized by the current generation detector network is accessible in a follow-up search.\n",
      "19        Lithium-drifted silicon [Si(Li)] has been used for decades as an ionizing radiation detector in nuclear, particle, and astrophysical experiments, though such detectors have frequently been limited to small sizes (few cm$^2$) and cryogenic operating temperatures. The 10-cm-diameter Si(Li) detectors developed for the General Antiparticle Spectrometer (GAPS) balloon-borne <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> experiment are novel particularly for their requirements of low cost, large sensitive area (~10 m$^2$ for the full 1440-detector array), high temperatures (near -40$\\,^\\circ$C), and energy resolution below 4 keV FWHM for 20--100-keV x-rays. Previous works have discussed the manufacturing, passivation, and small-scale testing of prototype GAPS Si(Li) detectors. Here we show for the first time the results from detailed characterization of over 1100 flight detectors, illustrating the consistent intrinsic low-noise performance of a large sample of GAPS detectors.

Assuming reheating takes place through perturbative quantum production from vacuum in presence of classical inflaton background field, we find that the spectral energy density of the primordial GW generated during inflation becomes sensitive to inflaton-<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> coupling. We conclude, obeying bounds from Big Bang Nucleosysthesis and Cosmic Microwave Background, that, e.g., inflaton-scalar couplings of the order of $\\sim\\mathcal{O}(10^{-20})$ GeV fall within the sensitivity range of several proposed GW detector facilities. However, this prediction is sensitive to the size of the inflationary scale, nature of the inflaton-<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> interaction and shape of the potential during reheating. Having found the time-dependent effective inflaton decay width, we also discuss its implications for <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> (DM) production from the thermal plasma via UV freeze-in during reheating. It is shown, that one can reproduce the observed DM abundance for its mass up to several PeVs, depending on the dimension of the operator connecting DM with the thermal bath and the associated scale of the UV physics. Thus we promote primordial GW to observables sensitive to feebly coupled inflaton, which is very challenging if not impossible to test in conventional particle physics laboratories or astrophysical measurements.\n",
      "22        We argue that demanding a consistent cosmological history, including the absence of domain walls and strongly interacting relics at the Peccei-Quinn scale, singles out two concrete realizations of hadronic QCD axions as viable <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> models. These realizations generally feature flavor-violating axion couplings to Standard Model quarks that are unsuppressed at low energies. As a consequence, experiments looking for flavor-violating hadronic processes involving the axion can be sensitive probes of QCD axion <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> models. In particular, we show that the NA62 and KOTO experiments could detect the $K\\rightarrowπ+ a$ decay for axions consistent with the observed <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> abundance via the post-inflationary misalignment mechanism.\n",
      "23        The mean <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> density within the turnaround radius, which is the boundary that separates a nonexpanding structure from the Hubble flow, was recently proposed as a novel cosmological probe. According to the spherical collapse model, the evolution with cosmic time of this turnaround density, $\\rm ρ_{ta}(z)$, can be used to determine both $\\rm Ω_m$ and $Ω_Λ$, independently of any other currently used probe. The properties of $\\rm ρ_{ta}$ predicted by the spherical collapse model were also shown to persist in the presence of full three-dimensional effects in $\\rm Λ$CDM N-body cosmological simulations when considering galaxy clusters at the present time, $z=0$. However, a small offset was discovered between the spherical-collapse prediction of the value of $ρ_{ta}$ at $z=0$ and its value measured in simulations. In this letter, we explore whether this offset evolves with cosmic time; whether it differs in different cosmologies; whether its origin can be confidently identified; and whether it can be corrected. We found that the offset does evolve slightly with redshift, and that it correlates strongly with the deviation from spherical symmetry of the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halo distribution inside and outside of the turnaround radius. We used an appropriate metric to quantify deviations in the environment of a structure from spherical symmetry. We found that using this metric, we can construct a sphericity-selected sample of halos for which the offset of $ρ_{ta}$ from the spherical collapse prediction is zero, independently of redshift and cosmology. We found that a sphericity-selected halo sample allows us to recover the simulated cosmology, and we conclude that the turnaround density evolution indeed encodes the cosmology in N-body simulations.\n",
      "24        We present a new suite of over 1,500 cosmological N-body simulations with varied Warm <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">Dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">Matter</span> (WDM) models ranging from 2.5 to 30 keV. We use these simulations to train Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to infer WDM particle masses from images of DM field data. Our fiducial setup can make accurate predictions of the WDM particle mass up to 7.5 keV at a 95% confidence level from small maps that cover an area of (25 h$^{-1}$ Mpc)$^2$. We vary the image resolution, simulation resolution, redshift, and cosmology of our fiducial setup to better understand how our model is making predictions. Using these variations, we find that our models are most dependent on simulation resolution, minimally dependent on image resolution, not systematically dependent on redshift, and robust to varied cosmologies. We also find that an important feature to distinguish between WDM models is present with a linear size between 100 and 200 h$^{-1}$ kpc. We compare our fiducial model to one trained on the power spectrum alone and find that our field-level model can make 2x more precise predictions and can make accurate predictions to 2x as massive WDM particle masses when used on the same data. Overall, we find that the field-level data can be used to accurately differentiate between WDM models and contain more information than is captured by the power spectrum. This technique can be extended to more complex DM models and opens up new opportunities to explore alternative DM models in a cosmological environment.\n",
      "25        The properties of globular clusters (GCs) contain valuable information of their host galaxies and <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span>-<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halos. In the remarkable example of ultra-diffuse galaxy, NGC5846-UDG1, the GC population exhibits strong radial mass segregation, indicative of dynamical-friction-driven orbital decay, which opens the possibility of using imaging data alone to constrain the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span>-<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> content of the galaxy. To explore this possibility, we develop a semi-analytical model of GC evolution, which starts from the initial mass function, the initial structure-mass relation, and the initial spatial distribution of the GC progenitors, and follows the effects of dynamical friction, tidal evolution, and two-body relaxation. Using Markov Chain Monte Carlo, we forward-model the GCs in a NGC5846-UDG1-like potential to match the observed GC mass, size, and spatial distributions, and to constrain the profile of the host halo and the origin of the GCs. We find that, with the assumptions of zero mass segregation when the star clusters were born, NGC5846-UDG1 is <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span>-<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> poor compared to what is expected from stellar-to-halo-mass relations, and its halo concentration is low, irrespective of having a cuspy or a cored halo profile. Its GC population has an initial spatial distribution more extended than the smooth stellar distribution. We discuss the results in the context of scaling laws of galaxy-halo connections, and warn against naively using the GC-abundance-halo-mass relation to infer the halo mass of UDGs. Our model is generally applicable to GC-rich dwarf galaxies, and is publicly available at https://github.com/JiangFangzhou/GCevo.\n",
      "26        The Epoch of Reionization (EoR) neutral Hydrogen (HI) 21-cm signal evolves significantly along the line-of-sight (LoS) due to the light-cone (LC) effect. It is important to accurately incorporate this in simulations in order to correctly interpret the signal. 21-cm LC simulations are typically produced by stitching together slices from a finite number $(N_{\\rm RS})$ of &#39;&#39;reionization snapshot&#39;&#39;, each corresponding to a different stage of reionization. In this paper, we have quantified the errors in the 21-cm LC simulation due to the finite value of $N_{\\rm RS}$. We show that this can introduce large discontinuities $(&gt; 200 \\%)$ at the stitching boundaries when $N_{\\rm RS}$ is small $(= 2,4)$ and the mean neutral fraction jumps by $δ\\bar{x}_{\\rm HI} = 0.2,0.1$ respectively at the stitching boundaries. This drops to $17 \\%$ for $N_{\\rm RS} = 13$ where $δ\\bar{x}_{\\rm HI}=0.02$. We present and also validate a method for mitigating this error by increasing $N_{\\rm RS}$ without a proportional increase in the computational costs which are mainly incurred in generating the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> and halo density fields. Our method generates these fields only at a few redshifts, and interpolates them to generate reionization snapshots at closely spaced redshifts. We use this to generate 21-cm LC simulations with $N_{\\rm RS} = 26,51,101$ and $201$, and show that the errors go down as $N_{\\rm RS}^{-1}$.\n",
      "27        The advent of gravitational wave astronomy has seen a huge influx of new predictions for potential discoveries of beyond the Standard Model fields. The coupling of all fundamental fields to gravity, together with its dominance on large scales, makes gravitational physics a rich laboratory to study fundamental physics. This holds especially true for the search for the elusive <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> photon, a promising <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> candidate. The <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> photon is predicted to generate instabilities in a rotating black hole spacetime, birthing a macroscopic Bose-Einstein condensate. These condensates can especially form around super massive black holes, modifying the dynamical inspiralling process. This then opens another window to leverage future space-borne gravitational wave antennas to join the hunt for the elusive <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> particle. This study builds a preliminary model for the gravitational waveform emitted by such a dressed extreme mass-ratio inspiral. Comparing these waveforms to the vacuum scenario allows projections to the potential constrainability on the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> photon mass by space-borne gravitational wave antennas. The superradiant instability of a massive vector field on a Kerr background is calculated and the modification to the dynamics of an inspiralling solar mass-scale compact object is determined with approximations on the backreaction effect of the cloud on the compact object. The end result is the projection that the LISA mission should be able to constrain the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> photon mass using extreme mass ratio inspirals in the range $[1.8 \\times 10^{-17}, 4.47 \\times 10^{-16}]$ eV.\n",
      "28        Recent observations made by the JWST have revealed a number of massive galaxies at high redshift ($z$). The presence of these galaxies appears at odds with the current $Λ$CDM cosmology. Here we investigate the possibility of alleviating the tension by incorporating uncertainties from three sources in counting massive galaxies at high $z$: cosmic variance, error in stellar mass estimate, and contribution by backsplash. We find that each of the sources can significantly increase the cumulative stellar mass density $ρ_*(&gt;M_*)$ at the high-mass end, and the combination of them can boost the density by more than one order of magnitude. Assuming a star formation efficiency of $ε_* \\sim 0.5$, cosmic variance alone can reduce the tension to $2σ$ level, except the most massive galaxy at $z=8$. Including in addition a lognormal dispersion with a width of 0.3 dex in the stellar mass can bring the observed stellar mass density at $z \\sim 7 - 10$ to the $2σ$ range of the cosmic variance. The tension is completely eliminated when gas stripped from backsplash halos is also taken into account. Our results highlight the importance of fully modeling uncertainties when interpreting observational data of rare objects. We use the constrained simulation, ELUCID, to investigate the descendants of high $z$ massive galaxies. We find that a significant portion of these galaxies end up in massive halos with mass $M_{\\rm halo} &gt; 10^{13} h^{-1}M_\\odot $ at $z=0$. A large fraction of central galaxies in $M_{\\rm halo} \\geqslant 10^{14.5} h^{-1}M_\\odot$ halos today are predicted to contain significant amounts of ancient stars formed in massive galaxies at $z\\sim 8$. This prediction can be tested by studying the structure and stellar population of central galaxies in present-day massive clusters.\n",
      "29        Within the $Λ$CDM cosmology, <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> haloes are comprised of both a smooth component and a population of smaller, gravitationally bound subhaloes. These components are often treated as a single halo when halo properties, such as density profiles, are extracted from simulations. Recent work has shown that density profiles change substantially when subhalo mass is excluded. In this paper, we expand on this result by analysing the change in three specific host halo properties -- concentration ($c_{\\rm{NFW}}$), spin ($λ_{\\rm Bullock}$), and shape ($c/a$), -- when calculated only from the smooth component of the halo. This analysis is performed on both Milky Way-mass haloes and cluster-mass haloes in high-resolution, zoom-in, $N$-body simulations. We find that when subhaloes are excluded the median value of (1) $c_{\\rm{NFW}}$ is enhanced by $\\approx 38 \\pm 12\\%$ and $\\approx 88 \\pm 7.7\\%$ for Milky Way mass ($10^{12.1}\\,\\text{M}_\\odot$) and cluster mass ($10^{14.8}\\,\\text{M}_\\odot$) haloes respectively, (2) $λ_{\\rm Bullock}$ is reduced for Milky Way mass by $\\approx 16 \\pm 6.8\\%$ and cluster mass haloes by $\\approx 32 \\pm 8.9\\%$. Additionally, with the removal of subhaloes, cluster mass haloes tend to become more spherical as the ratio of minor-to-major axis, $c/a$, increases by $\\approx 12 \\pm 4\\%$, whereas Milky Way mass haloes remain approximately the same shape with $c/a$ changed by $\\approx 1.2 \\pm 5.6\\%$. The fractional change of each of these properties depends primarily on the amount of mass that is removed from the halo system and, to a lesser extent, mass accretion history. Our findings demonstrate that the properties of the smooth components of <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> haloes are biased relative to the total mass of the halo including subhaloes.\n",
      "30        In order to test active galactic nucleus (AGN) unification and evolutionary models, we measured the AGN clustering properties as a function of AGN obscuration defined in terms of hydrogen column density, $N_{\\rm H}$. In addition to measuring the clustering of unobscured ($N_{\\rm H} &lt; 10^{22}\\,{\\rm cm}^{-2}$) and moderately obscured ($10^{22} \\leq N_{\\rm H} &lt; 10^{23.5}$) AGNs, we also targeted highly obscured sources ($N_{\\rm H}\\geq 10^{23.5}$) up to redshifts of $z=3$. We have compiled one of the largest samples of X-ray-selected AGNs from a total of eight deep XMM/Chandra surveys. We measured the clustering as a function of both AGN obscuration and redshift using the projected two-point correlation function, $w_{\\rm p}(r_{\\rm p})$. We modeled the large-scale clustering signal, measured the AGN bias, $b(z, N_{\\rm H})$, and interpreted it in terms of the typical AGN host <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halo, $M_{\\rm halo}(z, N_{\\rm H}$). We find no significant dependence of AGN clustering on obscuration, suggesting similar typical masses of the hosting halos as a function of $N_{\\rm H}$. This result matches expectations of AGN unification models, in which AGN obscuration depends mainly on the viewing angle of the obscuring torus. We measured, for the first time, the clustering of highly obscured AGNs and find that these objects reside in halos with typical mass $\\log M_{\\rm halo} = 12.98_{-0.22}^{+0.17} [h^{-1} M_\\odot]$ ($12.28_{-0.19}^{+0.13}$) at low $z \\sim 0.7$ (high $z \\sim 1.8$) redshifts. We find that irrespective of obscuration, an increase in AGN bias with redshift is slower than the expectation for a constant halo mass and instead follows the growth rate of halos, known as the passive evolution track. This implies that for those AGNs the clustering is mainly driven by the mass growth rate of the hosting halos and galaxies across cosmic time.\n",
      "31        Mergers between galaxy clusters are an important stage in the formation of the large-scale structure of the Universe. Some of the mergers show a spectacular bow shock that formed as a result of recent passage of a smaller cluster through a bigger one, the classic example of this being the so-called bullet cluster. In this paper, I describe ten examples of interacting clusters identified among 200 of the most massive objects, with total masses above $1.4 \\times 10^{14}$ M$_{\\odot}$, from the IllustrisTNG300 simulation by searching for prominent bow shocks in their temperature maps. Despite different mass ratios of the two merging clusters, the events are remarkably similar in many respects. In all cases, the companion cluster passed close to the main one only once, between 0.9 and 0.3 Gyr ago, with the pericenter distance of 100-530 kpc and a velocity of up to 3400 km s$^{-1}$. The subcluster, typically an order of magnitude smaller in mass than the main cluster before the interaction, loses most of its <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> and gas in the process. The displacement between the collisionless part of the remnant and the bow shock is such that the remnant typically lags behind the shock or coincides with it, with a single exception of the merger occurring with the largest velocity. Usually about 1% of the gas cells in the merging clusters are shocked, and the median Mach numbers of these gas cells are around two. Due to the relatively small size of the simulation box, no close analog of the bullet cluster was found, but I identified one case that is similar in terms of mass, velocity, and displacement. The presented cases bear more resemblance to less extreme observed interacting clusters such as A520 and Coma.\n",
      "32        Microscopic horizonless relics could form in the early universe either directly through gravitational collapse or as stable remnants of the Hawking evaporation of primordial black holes. In both cases they completely or partially evade cosmological constraints arising from Hawking evaporation and in certain mass ranges can explain the entirety of the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>. We systematically explore the stochastic gravitational-wave background associated with the formation of microscopic <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span>-<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> relics in various scenarios, adopting an agnostic approach and discussing the limitations introduced by existing constraints, possible ways to circumvent the latter, and expected astrophysical foregrounds.

      "33        In direct <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> (DM) detection via scattering off the electrons, the momentum transfer plays a crucial role. Previous work showed that for self-interacting DM, if the DM particle has a size (the so-called puffy DM), the radius effect could dominate the momentum transfer and become another source of velocity dependence for self-scattering cross section. In this work we investigate the direct detection of puffy DM particles with different radii through electron recoil. We find that comparing with the available experimental exclusion limits dominated by the mediator effect for XENON10, XENON100 and XENON1T, the constraints on the puffy DM-electron scattering cross-section become much weaker for large radius DM particles. For small-radius DM particles, the constraints remain similar to the point-like DM case.\n",
      "34        Boson stars are gravitationally bound objects that arise in ultralight <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> models and form in the centers of galactic halos or axion miniclusters. We systematically study the excitations of a boson star, taking into account the mixing between positive and negative frequencies introduced by gravity. We show that the spectrum contains zero-energy modes in the monopole and dipole sectors resulting from spontaneous symmetry breaking by the boson star background. We analyze the general properties of the eigenmodes and derive their orthogonality and completeness conditions which have non-standard form due to the positive-negative frequency mixing. The eigenvalue problem is solved numerically for the first few energy levels in different multipole sectors and the results are compared to the solutions of the Schrödinger equation in fixed boson star gravitational potential. The two solutions differ significantly for the lowest modes, but get close for higher levels. We further confirm the normal mode spectrum in 3D wave simulations where we inject perturbations with different multipoles. As an application of the normal mode solutions, we compute the matrix element entering the evaporation rate of a boson star immersed in a hot axion gas. The computation combines the use of exact wavefunctions for the low-lying bound states and of the Schrödinger approximation for the high-energy excitations.\n",
      "35        If long-range attractive forces exist and are stronger than gravity then cosmic halo formation can begin in the radiation-dominated era. We study a simple realization of this effect in a system where <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> fermions have Yukawa interactions mediated by scalar particles, analogous to the Higgs boson in the standard model. We develop a self-consistent description of the system including exact background dynamics of the scalar field, and precise modelling of the fermion density fluctuations. For the latter, we provide accurate approximations for the linear growth as well as quantitative modelling of the nonlinear evolution using N-body simulations. We find that halo formation occurs exponentially fast and on scales substantially larger than simple estimates predict. The final fate of these halos remains uncertain, but could be annihilation, <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> stars, primordial black holes, or even the existence of galaxy-sized halos at <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>-radiation equality. More generally, our results demonstrate the importance of mapping scalar-mediated interactions onto structure formation outcomes and constraints for beyond the standard model theories.\n",
      "36        Recent analysis on the stellar kinematics of ultra-faint dwarf (UFD) galaxies has put a stringent upper limit on the self-scattering cross section of <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>, i.e., $σ/m&lt;{\\cal O}(0.1)\\,{\\rm cm^2/g}$ at the scattering velocity of ${\\cal O}(10)\\,{\\rm km/s}$. Resonant self-interacting <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> (rSIDM) is one possibility that can be consistent with the UFDs and explain the low central densities of rotation-supported galaxies; the cross section is resonantly enhanced to be $σ/m = {\\cal O}(1)\\,{\\rm cm^2/g}$ around the scattering velocity of ${\\cal O}(100)\\,{\\rm km/s}$ while being suppressed at lower velocities. To further assess this possibility, since the inferred <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> distribution of halos from astrophysical observations is usually compared to that in constant-cross section SIDM (cSIDM), whether the structures of rSIDM halos can be approximated by the cSIDM halo profiles needs to be clarified. In this work, we employ the grovothermal fluid method to investigate the structural evolution of rSIDM halos in a wide mass range. We find that except for halos in a specific mass range, the present structures of rSIDM halos are virtually indistinguishable from those of the cSIDM halos. For halos in the specific mass range, the resonant self-scattering renders a break in their density profile. We demonstrate how such a density-profile break appears in astrophysical observations, e.g., rotation curves and line-of-sight velocity dispersion profiles. We show that for halos above the specific mass range, the density-profile break thermalizes to disappear before the present. We demonstrate that such distinctive thermalization dynamics can leave imprints on the orbital classes of stars with similar ages and metallicities.\n",
      "37        The E-type $α$-attractor models of single-field inflation were generalized further in order to accommodate production of primordial black holes (PBH) via adding a near-inflection point to the inflaton scalar potential at smaller scales, in good agreement with measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation. A minimal number of new parameters was used but their fine-tuning was maximized in order to increase possible masses of PBH formed during an ultra-slow-roll phase leading to a large enhancement of the power spectrum of scalar (curvature) perturbations by 6 or 7 orders of magnitude against the power spectrum of perturbations observed in CMB. It was found that extreme fine-tuning of the parameters in our models can lead to a formation of the Earth-size PBH with the masses of approximately $10^{27}$ g, still in agreement with CMB observations. Quantum corrections are known to lead to the perturbative upper bound on the amplitude of large scalar perturbations responsible for PBH production. The quantum (one-loop) corrections in our models were found to be suppressed by one order of magnitude for PBH with the masses of approximately $10^{19}$ g, which may form the whole <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> in the Universe.\n",

We study the requirements the model&#39;s parameters have to fulfill in order to reproduce the measured DM relic abundance through two possible production mechanisms in the early universe, freeze-in and misalignment, both during a standard radiation-dominated era and early <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> domination. We then study possible signals of type-II majoron DM and the present and expected constraints on the parameter space that can be obtained from cosmological observations, direct detection experiments, and present and future searches for decaying DM at neutrino telescopes and cosmic-ray experiments. We find that -- depending on the majoron mass, the production mechanism, and the value of the vacuum expectation value of the type-II triplet -- all of the three decay modes (photons, electrons, neutrinos) of majoron DM particles can yield observable signals at future indirect searches for DM. Furthermore, in a corner of the parameter space, detection of majoron DM is possible through electron recoil at running and future direct detection experiments.\n",
      "39        Running vacuum models and viscous <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> scenarios beyond perfect fluid idealization are two appealing theoretical strategies that have been separately studied as alternatives to solve some problems rooted in the $Λ$CDM cosmological model. In this paper, we combine these two notions in a single cosmological setting and investigate their cosmological implications, paying particular attention in the interplay between these two constituents in different cosmological periods. Specifically, we consider a well-studied running vacuum model inspired by renormalization group, and a recently proposed general parameterization for the bulk viscosity $ξ$. By employing dynamical system analysis, we explore the physical aspects of the new phase space that emerges from the combined models and derive stability conditions that ensure complete cosmological dynamics. We identify four distinct classes of models and find that the critical points of the phase space are non-trivially renewed compared to the single scenarios. We then proceed, in a joint and complementary way to the dynamical system analysis, with a detailed numerical exploration to quantify the impact of both the running parameter and the bulk viscosity coefficient on the cosmological evolution. Thus, for some values of the model parameters, numerical solutions show qualitative differences from the $Λ$CDM model, which is phenomenologically appealing in light of cosmological observations.\n",
      "40        The intrinsic alignment (IA) of observed galaxy shapes with the underlying cosmic web is a source of contamination in weak lensing surveys. Sensitive methods to identify the IA signal will therefore need to be included in the upcoming weak lensing analysis pipelines. Hydrodynamical cosmological simulations allow us to directly measure the intrinsic ellipticities of galaxies and thus provide a powerful approach to predict and understand the IA signal. Here we employ the novel, large-volume hydrodynamical simulation MTNG740, a product of the MillenniumTNG (MTNG) project, to study the IA of galaxies. We measure the projected correlation functions between the intrinsic shape/shear of galaxies and various tracers of large-scale structure, $w_{+g},\\ w_{+m},\\ w_{++}$ over the radial range $r_{\\rm p} \\in [0.02 , 200]\\,h^{-1}{\\rm Mpc}$ and at redshifts $z=0.0$, $0.5$ and $1.0$. We detect significant signal-to-noise IA signals with the density field for both elliptical and spiral galaxies. We also find significant intrinsic shear-shear correlations for ellipticals. We further examine correlations of the intrinsic shape of galaxies with the local tidal field. Here we find a significant IA signal for elliptical galaxies assuming a linear model. We also detect a weak IA signal for spiral galaxies under a quadratic tidal torquing model. Lastly, we measure the alignment between central galaxies and their host <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span>-<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halos, finding small to moderate misalignments between their principal axes that decline with halo mass.\n",

We explore the lensing maps over a large dynamic range in simulation mass and angular resolution, allowing us to establish a clear assessment of numerical convergence. By comparing full physics hydrodynamical simulations with corresponding <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span>-<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>-only runs we quantify the impact of baryonic physics on the most important weak lensing statistics. Likewise, we predict the impact of massive neutrinos reliably far into the non-linear regime. We also demonstrate that the &#34;fixed &amp; paired&#34; variance suppression technique increases the statistical robustness of the simulation predictions on large scales not only for time slices but also for continuously output lightcone data. We find that both baryonic and neutrino effects substantially impact weak lensing shear measurements, with the latter dominating over the former on large angular scales. Thus, both effects must explicitly be included to obtain sufficiently accurate predictions for stage IV lensing surveys. Reassuringly, our results agree accurately with other simulation results where available, supporting the promise of simulation modelling for precision cosmology far into the non-linear regime.\n",

We show how the resulting enhancement to the small-scale <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> power spectrum increases the microhalo abundance and boosts the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> annihilation rate. We then use gamma-ray observations to constrain thermal <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> production during kination. The annihilation boost factor depends on the minimum halo mass, which is determined by the small-scale cutoff in the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> power spectrum. Therefore, observational limits on the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> annihilation rate imply a minimum cutoff scale for a given <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> particle mass and kination scenario. For <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> that was once in thermal equilibrium with the Standard Model, this constraint establishes a maximum allowed kinetic decoupling temperature for the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>. This bound on the decoupling temperature implies that the growth of perturbations during kination cannot appreciably boost the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> annihilation rate if <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> was once in thermal equilibrium with the Standard Model.\n",
      "43        We present the measurement of total and stellar/<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> decomposed mass density profile around a sample of galaxy groups and clusters with dynamical masses derived from integral-field stellar kinematics from the MaNGA survey in Paper~I and weak lensing derived from the DECaLS imaging survey. Combining the two data sets enables accurate measurement of the radial density distribution from several kpc to Mpc scales. Intriguingly, we find that the excess surface density derived from stellar kinematics in the inner region cannot be explained by simply adding an NFW <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halo extrapolated from lensing measurement at a larger scale to a stellar mass component derived from the NASA-Sloan Atlas (NSA) catalog. We find that a good fit to both data sets requires a stellar mass normalization about 3 times higher than that derived from the NSA catalog, which would require an unrealistically too-heavy initial mass function for stellar mass estimation. If we keep the stellar mass normalization to that of the NSA catalog but allow a varying inner <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> density profile, we obtain an asymptotic slope of $γ_{\\rm gnfw}$= $1.82_{-0.25}^{+0.15}$, $γ_{\\rm gnfw}$= $1.48_{-0.41}^{+0.20}$ for the group bin and the cluster bin respectively, significantly steeper than the NFW case. We also compare the total mass inner density slopes with those from Illustris-TNG300 and find that the values from the simulation are lower than the observation by at least $3σ$ level.\n",
      "44        We present dynamical scaling relations, combined with the stellar population properties, for a subsample of about 6000 nearby galaxies with the most reliable dynamical models extracted from the full MaNGA sample of 10K galaxies. We show that the inclination-corrected mass plane (MP) for both early-type galaxies (ETGs) and late-type galaxies (LTGs), which links dynamical mass, projected half-light radius $R_{\\rm e}$, and the second stellar velocity moment $σ_{\\rm e}$ within $R_{\\rm e}$, satisfies the virial theorem and is even tighter than the uncorrected one. We find a clear parabolic relation between $\\lg(M/L)(&lt;R_{\\rm e})$, the total mass-to-light ratio within a sphere of radius $R_{\\rm e}$, and $\\lgσ_{\\rm e}$, with the $M/L$ increasing with $σ_{\\rm e}$ and for older stellar populations. However, the relation for ETGs is linear and the one for the youngest galaxies is constant. We confirm and improve the relation between average logarithmic total density slopes $γ_{_{\\rm T}}$ and $σ_{\\rm e}$: $γ_{_{\\rm T}}$ become steeper with increasing $σ_{\\rm e}$ until $\\lg(σ_{\\rm e}/{\\rm km\\,s^{-1}})\\approx 2.2$ and then remain constant around $γ_{_{\\rm T}}\\approx -2.2$. The $γ_{_{\\rm T}}-σ_{\\rm e}$ variation is larger for LTGs than ETGs. At fixed $σ_{\\rm e}$ the total density profiles steepen with galaxy age and for ETGs. We find generally low <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> fractions, median $f_{\\rm DM}(&lt;R_{\\rm e})=8$ per cent, within a sphere of radius $R_{\\rm e}$. However, we find that $f_{\\rm DM}(&lt;R_{\\rm e})$ depends on $σ_{\\rm e}$ better than stellar mass: <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> increases to a median $f_{\\rm DM}=33$ percent for galaxies with $σ_{\\rm e}\\lesssim100{\\rm km\\,s^{-1}}$. The increased $f_{\\rm DM}(&lt;R_{\\rm e})$ at low $σ_{\\rm e}$ explains the parabolic $\\lg(M/L)(&lt;R_{\\rm e})-\\lgσ_{\\rm e}$ relation.\n",
      "45        We analyze the global stellar population, radial gradients and non-parametric star formation history of $\\sim 10$K galaxies from the MaNGA Survey final data release 17 (DR17), based on stellar population synthesis and full-spectrum fitting, and relate them with dynamical properties of galaxies. We confirm that stellar population correlates with stellar velocity dispersion $σ_{\\rm e}$ better than with stellar mass $M_{\\ast}$, but also find that younger galaxies are more metal-poor at fixed $σ_{\\rm e}$. Stellar age, metallicity, and mass-to-light ratio $M_{\\ast}/L$ all decrease with galaxy rotation, while radial gradients become more negative (i.e., younger, more metal-poor, and lower $M_{\\ast}/L$ in the outskirts). The trend between metallicity gradients and rotation reverses for slow rotators, which stand out for their more negative metallicity gradients than faster-rotating galaxies. We highlight a population of massive disk galaxies on the green valley, on the $(σ_{\\rm e},\\rm Age)$ plane, that show steep negative age and metallicity gradients, consistent with their old central bulges surrounded by young star-forming disks and metal-poor gas accretion. Galaxies with high $σ_{\\rm e}$, steep total mass-density slope, low <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> fraction, high $M_{\\ast}/L$, and high metallicity have the highest star-formation rate at earlier times, and are currently quenched. We discover a population of low-mass star-forming galaxies with low rotation but physically distinct from the massive slow rotators. A catalogue of the population properties is provided publicly.\n",
      "46        This is the first paper in our series on the combined analysis of the Dynamics and stellar Population (DynPop) for the MaNGA survey in the final SDSS Data Release 17 (DR17). Here we present a catalogue of dynamically-determined quantities for over 10000 nearby galaxies based on integral-field stellar kinematics from the MaNGA survey. The dynamical properties are extracted using the axisymmetric Jeans Anisotropic Modelling (JAM) method, which was previously shown to be the most accurate for this kind of study. We assess systematic uncertainties using eight dynamical models with different assumptions. We use two orientations of the velocity ellipsoid: either cylindrically-aligned JAM$_{\\rm cyl}$ or spherically-aligned JAM$_{\\rm sph}$. We also make four assumptions for the models&#39; <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> vs. luminous <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> distributions: (1) mass-follows-light, (2) free NFW <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> halo, (3) cosmologically-constrained NFW halo, (4) generalized NFW <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> halo, i.e. with free inner slope. In this catalogue, we provide the quantities related to the mass distributions (e.g. the density slopes and enclosed mass within a sphere of a given radius for total mass, stellar mass, and <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> mass components). We also provide the complete models which can be used to compute the full luminous and mass distribution of each galaxy. Additionally, we visually assess the qualities of the models to help with model selections. We estimate the observed scatter in the measured quantities which decreases as expected with improvements in quality. For the best data quality, we find a remarkable consistency of measured quantities between different models, highlighting the robustness of the results.\n",
      "47        What is the highest energy at which gravitons can be observed? We address this question by studying graviton-to-photon conversion - the inverse-Gertsenshtein effect - in the magnetic field of the Milky Way. We find that above $\\sim 1~\\mbox{PeV}$ the effective photon mass grows large enough to quench the conversion rate. The induced photon flux is comparable to the sensitivity of LHAASO to a diffuse $γ$-ray background, but only for graviton abundances of order $Ω_{\\text{gw}} h^2_0 \\sim 1$. In the future, owing to a better understanding of $γ$-ray backgrounds, larger effective areas and longer observation times, sub-PeV shimmering gravitons with a realistic abundance of $Ω_{\\text{gw}} h^2_0 \\sim 0.01$ could be detected. We show that this is achieved in a cosmologically-motivated scenario of post-recombination superheavy <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> decay. Therefore, the sub-PeV range might be the ultimate energy frontier at which gravitons can be observed.\n",
      "48        The relation between the total mass contained in the globular clusters of a galaxy and the mass of its <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halo has been found observationally to be nearly linear over five decades of mass. However, the high-mass end of this relation is not well determined from previous data and shows large scatter. We analyze the globular cluster systems (GCSs) of a homogeneous sample of 11 brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) through DOLPHOT photometry of their deep Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images in the F814W filter. We standardize the definition of $M_{GCS}$, the total GCS mass, by using the GC total population within a limiting radius of $0.1 R_{virial}$, while the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span>-<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halo mass $M_h$ is determined from the weak-lensing calibration of $M_h$ versus $M_{bary}$. When these 11 BCGs are added to the previously studied homogeneous catalogue of Virgo member galaxies, a total value for $η= M_{GCS}/M_h$ is found to be $(3.0\\pm1.8_{internal})\\times10^{-5}$, slightly higher than previous estimates but with much reduced uncertainty. Perhaps more importantly, the results suggest that the relation continues to have a near-linear shape at the highest galaxy masses, strongly reinforcing the conclusion that accreted GCs make a major contribution to the GC populations at high galaxy mass.\n",
      "49        We introduce an analytic surface density profile for <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halos that accurately reproduces the structure of simulated halos of mass $M_{\\rm vir} = 10^{7-11}\\ M_\\odot$, making it useful for modeling line-of-sight perturbers in strong gravitational lensing models. The two-parameter function has an analytic deflection potential and is more accurate than the projected Navarro, Frenk &amp; White (NFW) profile commonly adopted at this mass scale for perturbers, especially at the small radii of most relevant for lensing perturbations. Using a characteristic radius, $R_{-1}$, where the log slope of surface density is equal to $-1$, and an associated surface density, $Σ_{-1}$, we can represent the expected lensing signal from line-of-sight halos statistically, for an ensemble of halo orientations, using a distribution of {\\em projected concentration} parameters, $\\mathcal{C}_{\\rm vir} := r_{\\rm vir}/ R_{-1}$. Though an individual halo can have a projected concentration that varies with orientation with respect to the observer, the range of projected concentrations correlates with the usual three-dimensional halo concentration in a way that enables ease of use.\n",
      "50        Axions and axion-like particles (ALPs) are a prominent <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> candidate, drawing motivation in part from the axiverse of string theory. Axion-like particles can also arise as composite degrees of freedom of a <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> sector, for example, as <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> pions in <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> Quantum Chromo-Dynamics. In a <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> Standard Model (SM) wherein all 6 quark flavors are light while the photon is massive, one finds a rich low-energy spectrum of stable and ultralight particles, in the form of neutral and charged <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> scalars, and complex neutral scalars analogous to the SM kaon, with mass splittings determined by the mass and charge of the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> quarks. The model finds a natural portal to the visible sector via kinetic coupling of the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> and visible photons, and consequent millicharges for <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>. The <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> can be a mixture of all these ultralight bosonic degrees of freedom, and exhibit both parity-even and parity-odd interactions, making the theory testable at a wide variety of experiments. In context of <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> QCD with $N_f$ flavors of light quarks, this scenario predicts $N_f^2-1$ ultralight axion-like particles -- effectively an axiverse from <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> QCD. This &#39;$π$-axiverse&#39; is consistent with but makes no recourse to string theory, and is complementary to the conventional string theory axiverse.\n",
      "51        The most luminous quasars at $z &gt; 6$ are suspected to be both highly clustered and reside in the most massive <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halos in the early Universe, making them prime targets to search for galaxy overdensities and/or protoclusters. We search for Lyman-break dropout-selected galaxies using HST WFC3/ACS broadband imaging in the fields of three $6 &lt; z &lt; 7$ quasars, as well as their simultaneously observed coordinated-parallel fields, and constrain their photometric redshifts using EAZY. One field, J0305-3150, shows a volume density 10$\\times$ higher than the blank-field UV luminosity function (UVLF) at M$_{UV} &lt; -20$, with tentative evidence of a 3$σ$ overdensity in its parallel field located 15 cMpc away. Another field, J2054-0005, shows an angular overdensity within 500 ckpc from the quasar but still consistent with UVLF predictions within 3$σ$, while the last field, J2348-3054, shows no enhancement. We discuss methods for reducing uncertainty in overdensity measurements when using photometric selection and show that we can robustly select LBGs consistent with being physically associated with the quasar, corroborated by existing JWST/NIRCam WFSS data in the J0305 field. Even accounting for incompleteness, the overdensities in J0305 and J2054 are higher for brighter galaxies at short angular separations, suggesting preferential enhancement of more massive galaxies in the immediate vicinity of the quasar. Finally, we compare the LBG population with previously-identified [CII] and mm-continuum companions; the LBG overdensities are not accompanied by an enhanced number of dusty galaxies, suggesting that the overdense quasar fields are not in the bursty star-forming phase sometimes seen in high-redshift protoclusters.\n"

The effects of DM on NS properties, including the mass-radius relation, the moment of inertia, and tidal deformability, are calculated by varying its fraction. The study found that the EOS becomes softer with increasing DM momentum, and the DM has marginal effects on nuclear <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> properties, except for the EOSs and binding energy per particle. The study also calculated the properties of isolated, static, and rotating DM admixed NS and found that the DM has significant effects on both static and rotating NS. We have also observed that a tiny amount of DM can accumulate inside the NS, and more amount of it makes the NS unstable. The study also suggests that the secondary component might be a NS with DM content if the underlying nuclear EOS is sufficiently stiff. The $f$-mode oscillations of the DM admixed hyperon stars are calculated and found that there exist a correlation between canonical $f$-mode frequency and the dimensionless tidal deformability parameter ($Λ_{1.4}$) and we have put a constraint on $f$-mode frequency using GW170817 data. Finally, we have calculated the DM admixed binary NS properties and found that the binary system becomes less deformed and sustains more time in its inspiral phases with the addition of DM. Therefore, we suggest that one can take DM inside the compact objects while modeling the inspiral waveforms for the BNS systems.\n",
      "3        Radiative emissions from electrons and positrons generated by <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> (DM) annihilation or decay are one of the most investigated signals in indirect searches of WIMPs. Ideal targets must have large ratio of DM to baryonic <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>. However, such ``<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span>&#39;&#39; systems have a poorly known level of magnetic turbulence, which determines the residence time of the electrons and positrons and therefore also the strength of the expected signal. This typically leads to significant uncertainties in the derived DM bounds. In a novel approach, we compute the self-confinement of the DM-induced electrons and positrons. Indeed, they themselves generate irregularities in the magnetic field, thus setting a lower limit on the presence of the magnetic turbulence. We specifically apply this approach to dwarf spheroidal galaxies. Finally, by comparing the expected synchrotron emission with radio data from the direction of the Draco galaxy collected at the Giant Metre Radio Telescope, we show that the proposed approach can be used to set robust and competitive bounds on WIMP DM.\n",
      "4        The particle origin of <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> (DM) is still one of the main puzzles in modern physics. One of the most promising search strategy to detect DM at laboratories is through the indirect search of cosmic particles that are produced from DM annihilation in space. In particular, the flux of cosmic positrons has been measured with high precision by the AMS-02 experiment demonstrating that an excess above 10 GeV, with respect to the secondary production, is present. We study in this paper the possible DM origin of the positron excess finding the values of the DM mass $M$ and annihilation cross section $\\langle σv \\rangle$ that are needed to fit high-energy positron data. In particular, we find that for DM annihilating into $b\\bar{b}$ it is required to have $M=43$ TeV and $\\langle σv \\rangle = 10^{-21}$ cm$^3$/s while for $τ^+τ^-$ $M=2$ TeV and $\\langle σv \\rangle = 3\\times 10^{-23}$ cm$^3$/s. If DM produce positrons, they are expected to generate gamma rays from the center of the Milky Way and around dwarf galaxy satellites of the Galaxy. We thus combine the values for the DM mass and annihilation cross section obtained with the fit to AMS-02 positron data with the upper limits derived with the non-detection of $γ$ rays with HESS in the direction of the Galactic center and Fermi-LAT for the combined analysis of dwarf galaxies. The main result of the paper is that only DM annihilating into $μ^+ μ^-$ with a mass around 500 GeV and $\\langle σv \\rangle = 4\\times 10^{-24}$ cm$^3$/s can fit AMS-02 data and be compatible with the upper limits found with $γ$ rays. As for the $τ^+ τ^-$ ($b\\bar{b}$) channel, DM can contribute at most at a few tens $\\%$ (a few \\%) level.\n",

      "6        Numerous observations suggest that there exist undiscovered beyond-the-Standard-Model particles and fields. Because of their unknown nature, these exotic particles and fields could interact with Standard Model particles in many different ways and assume a variety of possible configurations. Here we present an overview of the Global Network of Optical Magnetometers for Exotic physics searches (GNOME), our ongoing experimental program designed to test a wide range of exotic physics scenarios. The GNOME experiment utilizes a worldwide network of shielded atomic magnetometers (and, more recently, comagnetometers) to search for spatially and temporally correlated signals due to torques on atomic spins from exotic fields of astrophysical origin.

      "7        Recent observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) are yielding tantalizing hints of an early population of massive, bright galaxies at $z &gt; 10$, with Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) observations indicating significant dust masses in place as early as $z\\sim 7$. To understand the implications of these observations, we use the DELPHI semi-analytic model that jointly tracks the assembly of <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halos and their constituent baryons, including the key processes of dust enrichment. Our model employs only two redshift- and mass-independent free parameters that are tuned against all available galaxy data at $z \\sim 5-9$ before it is used to make predictions up to $z \\sim 20$. Our key results are: (1) the model progressively under-predicts the observed ultraviolet luminosity function (UV LF) at $z &gt; 12$; observations at $z&gt;16$ lie close to, or even above, a &#34;maximal&#34; model where all available gas is turned into stars; (2) UV selection would miss 34% of the star formation rate density at $z \\sim 5$, decreasing to 17% by $z \\sim 10$ for bright galaxies with $\\rm{M_{UV}} &lt; -19$; (3) the dust mass ($M_d$) evolves with the stellar mass ($M_*$) and redshift as $\\log(M_d) = 1.194\\log(M_*) + 0.0975z - 5.433$; (4) the escape fraction of UV photons ($f_{\\rm esc}^{\\rm UV}$) decreases with increasing mass and star formation rate. At $z \\sim 7$, $f_{\\rm esc}^{\\rm UV} \\sim 0.8~(0.1)$ for $M_* \\sim 10^9~ (10^{11}) \\, M_\\odot$ galaxies; (5) the dust temperature increases with stellar mass, ranging between $30-33$ K for $M_* \\sim 10^{9-11}M_\\odot$ galaxies at $z \\sim 7$. Finally, we predict the far infrared (FIR) LF at $z \\sim 5-20$, testable with ALMA observations, and caution that spectroscopic redshifts and dust masses must be pinned down before invoking unphysical extrema in galaxy formation models.\n",

We compute how this picture is modified at next-to-leading order (NLO) with the goal of assigning a reliable theory uncertainty to the freeze-out predictions. We explicitly compute NLO corrections in a simple model with abelian gauge interactions and provide an estimate of the theoretical uncertainty for the thermal masses of heavy electroweak $n$-plets. Along the way, we clarify the regularization and matching procedure necessary to deal with singular potentials in quantum mechanics with a calculable relativistic UV completion.\n",

We consider many nonrelativistic interactions up to quartic order in the Schrödinger field (both short and long-range, and spin-dependent and spin-independent interactions), including explicit spin-orbit couplings. The algorithm allows for spatially varying external and/or self-generated vector potentials that couple to the spin density of the field.

      "11        We explore an extension of the standard $Λ$CDM model by including an interaction between neutrinos and <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>, and making use of the ground based telescope data of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT). An indication for a non-zero coupling between <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> and neutrinos (both assuming a temperature independent and $T^2$ dependent cross-section) is obtained at the 1$σ$ level coming from the ACT CMB data alone and when combined with the Planck CMB and Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) measurements. This result is confirmed by both fixing the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom in the early Universe to the Standard Model value of $N_{\\rm eff}=3.044$, and allowing $N_{\\rm eff}$ to be a free cosmological parameter. Furthermore, when performing a Bayesian model comparison, the interacting $ν$DM (+$N_{\\rm eff}$) scenario is mostly preferred over a baseline $Λ$CDM (+$N_{\\rm eff}$) cosmology. The preferred value is then used as a benchmark and the potential implications of <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter&#39;s</span> interaction with a sterile neutrino are discussed.\n",
      "12        We present an innovative approach to constraining the non-cold <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> model using a convolutional neural network (CNN). We perform a suite of hydrodynamic simulations with varying <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> particle masses and generate mock 21cm radio intensity maps to trace the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> distribution. Our proposed method complements the traditional power spectrum analysis. We compare our CNN classification results with those from the power spectrum of the differential brightness temperature map of 21cm radiation, and find that the CNN outperforms the latter. Moreover, we investigate the impact of baryonic physics on the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> model constraint, including star formation, self-shielding of HI gas, and UV background model. We find that these effects may introduce some contamination in the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> constraint, but they are insignificant when compared to the realistic system noise of the SKA instruments.\n",
      "13        The <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> power spectrum has been strongly constrained by astronomical measurements at large scales, but only weakly at small scales. Compared with the standard scenario, the deviation of the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> power spectrum at small scales has influence on the cosmological structure formation, e.g., the comoving number density of <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halos. The thermal history of the intergalactic medium (IGM) can be changed if <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> is made of weakly interacting massive particles and can annihilate into standard model particles. The changes of the evolution of IGM could leave imprints on the relevant astronomical observations. Taking into account the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> annihilation, we investigate the impact of the deviation of <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> power spectrum at small scales on the global 21-cm signal. In view of the measurements of the global 21-cm signal by the EDGES experiment, we explore the allowed parameter space of $m_s$, which describes the degree of deviation, by requiring the differential brightness temperature of the global 21-cm signal $δT_{21} \\le -50~\\rm mK$ at redshift $z=17$.\n",
      "14        Using Low Brightness Surface Galaxies (LBSG) rotational curves we inferred the free parameters of $\\ell$-boson stars as a <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> component. The $\\ell$-boson stars are numerical solutions to the non-relativistic limit of the Einstein-Klein-Gordon system, the Schrödinger-Poisson (SP) system. These solutions are parametrized by an angular momentum number $\\ell = (N-1)/2$ and an excitation number $n$. We perform a bayesian analysis by modifying the SimpleMC code to perform the parameter inference, for the cases with $\\ell = 0$, $\\ell = 1$ and multistates of $\\ell$-boson stars. We used the Akaike information criterion (AIC), Bayesian information criterion and the Bayes factor to compare the excited state ($\\ell$=1) and the multistate case with the ground state ($\\ell$=0) as the base model due to its simplicity. We found that the data in most galaxies in the sample favours the multistates case and that the scalar field mass tends to be slightly bigger than the ground state case.\n",
      "15        A long-standing observed curiosity of globular clusters (GCs) has been that both the number and total mass of GCs in a galaxy are linearly correlated with the galaxy&#39;s virial mass, whereas its stellar component shows no such linear correlation. This work expands on an empirical model for the numbers and ages of GCs in galaxies presented by Valenzuela et al. (2021) that is consistent with recent observational data from massive elliptical galaxies down to the dwarf galaxy regime. Applying the model to simulations, GC numbers are shown to be excellent tracers for the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> (DM) virial mass, even when distinct formation mechanisms are employed for blue and red GCs. Furthermore, the amount of DM smooth accretion is encoded in the GC abundances, therefore providing a measure for an otherwise nearly untraceable component of the formation history of galaxies.\n",
      "16        We analytically solve the problem of Bose star growth in the bath of gravitationally interacting particles. We find that after nucleation of this object, the bath is described by a self-similar solution of the kinetic equation, which is an attractor. Together with the conservation laws, this fixes mass evolution of the Bose star. Our results explain slowdown of the star growth at a certain &#34;core-halo&#34; mass, but also predict formation of the heavier and lighter objects in magistral <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> models.\n",
      "17        <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">Dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> subhaloes are key for the predictions of simulations of structure formation, but their existence frequently ends prematurely due to two technical issues, namely numerical disruption in N-body simulations and halo finders failing to identify them. Here we focus on the second issue, using the phase-space friends-of-friends halo finder ROCKSTAR as a benchmark (though we expect our results to translate to comparable codes). We confirm that the most prominent cause for losing track of subhaloes is tidal distortion rather than a low number of particles. As a solution, we present a flexible post-processing algorithm that tracks all subhalo particles over time, computes subhalo positions and masses based on those particles, and progressively removes stripped <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>. If a subhalo is lost by the halo finder, this algorithm keeps tracking its so-called ghost until it has almost no particles left or has truly merged with its host. We apply this technique to a large suite of N-body simulations and restore lost subhaloes to the halo catalogues, which has a dramatic effect on key summary statistics of large-scale structure. Specifically, the subhalo mass function increases by about 50% and the halo correlation function increases by a factor of two at small scales. While these quantitative results are somewhat specific to our algorithm, they demonstrate that particle tracking is a promising way to reliably follow haloes and reduce the need for orphan models. Our algorithm and augmented halo catalogues are publicly available.\n",
      "18        Ultralight bosons are predicted in many extensions to the Standard Model and are popular <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> candidates. The black hole superradiance mechanism allows for these particles to be probed using only their gravitational interaction. In this scenario, an ultralight boson cloud may form spontaneously around a spinning black hole and extract a non-negligible fraction of the black hole&#39;s mass. These oscillating clouds produce quasi-monochromatic, long-duration gravitational waves that may be detectable by ground-based or space-based gravitational wave detectors. We discuss the capability of a new long-duration signal tracking method, based on a hidden Markov model, to detect gravitational wave signals generated by ultralight vector boson clouds, including cases where the signal frequency evolution timescale is much shorter than that of a typical continuous wave signal. We quantify the detection horizon distances for vector boson clouds with current- and next-generation ground-based detectors. We demonstrate that vector clouds hosted by black holes with mass $\\gtrsim 60 M_{\\odot}$ and spin $\\gtrsim 0.6$ are within the reach of current-generation detectors up to a luminosity distance of $\\sim 1$ Gpc. This search method enables one to target vector boson clouds around remnant black holes from compact binary mergers detected by gravitational-wave detectors. We discuss the impact of the sky localization of the merger events and demonstrate that a typical remnant black hole reasonably well-localized by the current generation detector network is accessible in a follow-up search.\n",
      "19        Lithium-drifted silicon [Si(Li)] has been used for decades as an ionizing radiation detector in nuclear, particle, and astrophysical experiments, though such detectors have frequently been limited to small sizes (few cm$^2$) and cryogenic operating temperatures. The 10-cm-diameter Si(Li) detectors developed for the General Antiparticle Spectrometer (GAPS) balloon-borne <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> experiment are novel particularly for their requirements of low cost, large sensitive area (~10 m$^2$ for the full 1440-detector array), high temperatures (near -40$\\,^\\circ$C), and energy resolution below 4 keV FWHM for 20--100-keV x-rays. Previous works have discussed the manufacturing, passivation, and small-scale testing of prototype GAPS Si(Li) detectors. Here we show for the first time the results from detailed characterization of over 1100 flight detectors, illustrating the consistent intrinsic low-noise performance of a large sample of GAPS detectors. This work demonstrates the feasibility of large-area and low-cost Si(Li) detector arrays for next-generation astrophysics and nuclear physics applications.\n",

The boosted <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">Dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">Matter</span> flux at the edge of the Earth&#39;s atmosphere is expected to be pointing to the Galactic Center, with a flux 15 to 20 times larger than in the transverse direction.\n",
      "21        We investigate the reach of future gravitational wave (GW) detectors in probing inflaton couplings with visible sector particles that can either be bosonic or fermionic in nature. Assuming reheating takes place through perturbative quantum production from vacuum in presence of classical inflaton background field, we find that the spectral energy density of the primordial GW generated during inflation becomes sensitive to inflaton-<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> coupling. We conclude, obeying bounds from Big Bang Nucleosysthesis and Cosmic Microwave Background, that, e.g., inflaton-scalar couplings of the order of $\\sim\\mathcal{O}(10^{-20})$ GeV fall within the sensitivity range of several proposed GW detector facilities. However, this prediction is sensitive to the size of the inflationary scale, nature of the inflaton-<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> interaction and shape of the potential during reheating. Having found the time-dependent effective inflaton decay width, we also discuss its implications for <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> (DM) production from the thermal plasma via UV freeze-in during reheating. It is shown, that one can reproduce the observed DM abundance for its mass up to several PeVs, depending on the dimension of the operator connecting DM with the thermal bath and the associated scale of the UV physics. Thus we promote primordial GW to observables sensitive to feebly coupled inflaton, which is very challenging if not impossible to test in conventional particle physics laboratories or astrophysical measurements.\n",
      "22        We argue that demanding a consistent cosmological history, including the absence of domain walls and strongly interacting relics at the Peccei-Quinn scale, singles out two concrete realizations of hadronic QCD axions as viable <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> models. These realizations generally feature flavor-violating axion couplings to Standard Model quarks that are unsuppressed at low energies. As a consequence, experiments looking for flavor-violating hadronic processes involving the axion can be sensitive probes of QCD axion <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> models. In particular, we show that the NA62 and KOTO experiments could detect the $K\\rightarrowπ+ a$ decay for axions consistent with the observed <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> abundance via the post-inflationary misalignment mechanism.\n",
      "23        The mean <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> density within the turnaround radius, which is the boundary that separates a nonexpanding structure from the Hubble flow, was recently proposed as a novel cosmological probe. According to the spherical collapse model, the evolution with cosmic time of this turnaround density, $\\rm ρ_{ta}(z)$, can be used to determine both $\\rm Ω_m$ and $Ω_Λ$, independently of any other currently used probe. The properties of $\\rm ρ_{ta}$ predicted by the spherical collapse model were also shown to persist in the presence of full three-dimensional effects in $\\rm Λ$CDM N-body cosmological simulations when considering galaxy clusters at the present time, $z=0$. However, a small offset was discovered between the spherical-collapse prediction of the value of $ρ_{ta}$ at $z=0$ and its value measured in simulations. In this letter, we explore whether this offset evolves with cosmic time; whether it differs in different cosmologies; whether its origin can be confidently identified; and whether it can be corrected. We found that the offset does evolve slightly with redshift, and that it correlates strongly with the deviation from spherical symmetry of the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halo distribution inside and outside of the turnaround radius. We used an appropriate metric to quantify deviations in the environment of a structure from spherical symmetry. We found that using this metric, we can construct a sphericity-selected sample of halos for which the offset of $ρ_{ta}$ from the spherical collapse prediction is zero, independently of redshift and cosmology. We found that a sphericity-selected halo sample allows us to recover the simulated cosmology, and we conclude that the turnaround density evolution indeed encodes the cosmology in N-body simulations.\n",
      "24        We present a new suite of over 1,500 cosmological N-body simulations with varied Warm <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">Dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">Matter</span> (WDM) models ranging from 2.5 to 30 keV. We use these simulations to train Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to infer WDM particle masses from images of DM field data. Our fiducial setup can make accurate predictions of the WDM particle mass up to 7.5 keV at a 95% confidence level from small maps that cover an area of (25 h$^{-1}$ Mpc)$^2$. We vary the image resolution, simulation resolution, redshift, and cosmology of our fiducial setup to better understand how our model is making predictions. Using these variations, we find that our models are most dependent on simulation resolution, minimally dependent on image resolution, not systematically dependent on redshift, and robust to varied cosmologies. We also find that an important feature to distinguish between WDM models is present with a linear size between 100 and 200 h$^{-1}$ kpc. We compare our fiducial model to one trained on the power spectrum alone and find that our field-level model can make 2x more precise predictions and can make accurate predictions to 2x as massive WDM particle masses when used on the same data. Overall, we find that the field-level data can be used to accurately differentiate between WDM models and contain more information than is captured by the power spectrum. This technique can be extended to more complex DM models and opens up new opportunities to explore alternative DM models in a cosmological environment.\n",
      "25        The properties of globular clusters (GCs) contain valuable information of their host galaxies and <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span>-<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halos. In the remarkable example of ultra-diffuse galaxy, NGC5846-UDG1, the GC population exhibits strong radial mass segregation, indicative of dynamical-friction-driven orbital decay, which opens the possibility of using imaging data alone to constrain the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span>-<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> content of the galaxy. To explore this possibility, we develop a semi-analytical model of GC evolution, which starts from the initial mass function, the initial structure-mass relation, and the initial spatial distribution of the GC progenitors, and follows the effects of dynamical friction, tidal evolution, and two-body relaxation. Using Markov Chain Monte Carlo, we forward-model the GCs in a NGC5846-UDG1-like potential to match the observed GC mass, size, and spatial distributions, and to constrain the profile of the host halo and the origin of the GCs. We find that, with the assumptions of zero mass segregation when the star clusters were born, NGC5846-UDG1 is <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span>-<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> poor compared to what is expected from stellar-to-halo-mass relations, and its halo concentration is low, irrespective of having a cuspy or a cored halo profile. Its GC population has an initial spatial distribution more extended than the smooth stellar distribution. We discuss the results in the context of scaling laws of galaxy-halo connections, and warn against naively using the GC-abundance-halo-mass relation to infer the halo mass of UDGs. Our model is generally applicable to GC-rich dwarf galaxies, and is publicly available at https://github.com/JiangFangzhou/GCevo.\n",
      "26        The Epoch of Reionization (EoR) neutral Hydrogen (HI) 21-cm signal evolves significantly along the line-of-sight (LoS) due to the light-cone (LC) effect. It is important to accurately incorporate this in simulations in order to correctly interpret the signal. 21-cm LC simulations are typically produced by stitching together slices from a finite number $(N_{\\rm RS})$ of &#39;&#39;reionization snapshot&#39;&#39;, each corresponding to a different stage of reionization. In this paper, we have quantified the errors in the 21-cm LC simulation due to the finite value of $N_{\\rm RS}$. We show that this can introduce large discontinuities $(&gt; 200 \\%)$ at the stitching boundaries when $N_{\\rm RS}$ is small $(= 2,4)$ and the mean neutral fraction jumps by $δ\\bar{x}_{\\rm HI} = 0.2,0.1$ respectively at the stitching boundaries. This drops to $17 \\%$ for $N_{\\rm RS} = 13$ where $δ\\bar{x}_{\\rm HI}=0.02$. We present and also validate a method for mitigating this error by increasing $N_{\\rm RS}$ without a proportional increase in the computational costs which are mainly incurred in generating the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> and halo density fields. Our method generates these fields only at a few redshifts, and interpolates them to generate reionization snapshots at closely spaced redshifts. We use this to generate 21-cm LC simulations with $N_{\\rm RS} = 26,51,101$ and $201$, and show that the errors go down as $N_{\\rm RS}^{-1}$.\n",
      "27        The advent of gravitational wave astronomy has seen a huge influx of new predictions for potential discoveries of beyond the Standard Model fields. The coupling of all fundamental fields to gravity, together with its dominance on large scales, makes gravitational physics a rich laboratory to study fundamental physics. This holds especially true for the search for the elusive <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> photon, a promising <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> candidate. The <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> photon is predicted to generate instabilities in a rotating black hole spacetime, birthing a macroscopic Bose-Einstein condensate. These condensates can especially form around super massive black holes, modifying the dynamical inspiralling process. This then opens another window to leverage future space-borne gravitational wave antennas to join the hunt for the elusive <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> particle. This study builds a preliminary model for the gravitational waveform emitted by such a dressed extreme mass-ratio inspiral. Comparing these waveforms to the vacuum scenario allows projections to the potential constrainability on the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> photon mass by space-borne gravitational wave antennas. The superradiant instability of a massive vector field on a Kerr background is calculated and the modification to the dynamics of an inspiralling solar mass-scale compact object is determined with approximations on the backreaction effect of the cloud on the compact object. The end result is the projection that the LISA mission should be able to constrain the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> photon mass using extreme mass ratio inspirals in the range $[1.8 \\times 10^{-17}, 4.47 \\times 10^{-16}]$ eV.\n",
      "28        Recent observations made by the JWST have revealed a number of massive galaxies at high redshift ($z$). The presence of these galaxies appears at odds with the current $Λ$CDM cosmology. Here we investigate the possibility of alleviating the tension by incorporating uncertainties from three sources in counting massive galaxies at high $z$: cosmic variance, error in stellar mass estimate, and contribution by backsplash. We find that each of the sources can significantly increase the cumulative stellar mass density $ρ_*(&gt;M_*)$ at the high-mass end, and the combination of them can boost the density by more than one order of magnitude. Assuming a star formation efficiency of $ε_* \\sim 0.5$, cosmic variance alone can reduce the tension to $2σ$ level, except the most massive galaxy at $z=8$. Including in addition a lognormal dispersion with a width of 0.3 dex in the stellar mass can bring the observed stellar mass density at $z \\sim 7 - 10$ to the $2σ$ range of the cosmic variance. The tension is completely eliminated when gas stripped from backsplash halos is also taken into account. Our results highlight the importance of fully modeling uncertainties when interpreting observational data of rare objects. We use the constrained simulation, ELUCID, to investigate the descendants of high $z$ massive galaxies. We find that a significant portion of these galaxies end up in massive halos with mass $M_{\\rm halo} &gt; 10^{13} h^{-1}M_\\odot $ at $z=0$. A large fraction of central galaxies in $M_{\\rm halo} \\geqslant 10^{14.5} h^{-1}M_\\odot$ halos today are predicted to contain significant amounts of ancient stars formed in massive galaxies at $z\\sim 8$. This prediction can be tested by studying the structure and stellar population of central galaxies in present-day massive clusters.\n",
      "29        Within the $Λ$CDM cosmology, <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> haloes are comprised of both a smooth component and a population of smaller, gravitationally bound subhaloes. These components are often treated as a single halo when halo properties, such as density profiles, are extracted from simulations. Recent work has shown that density profiles change substantially when subhalo mass is excluded. In this paper, we expand on this result by analysing the change in three specific host halo properties -- concentration ($c_{\\rm{NFW}}$), spin ($λ_{\\rm Bullock}$), and shape ($c/a$), -- when calculated only from the smooth component of the halo. This analysis is performed on both Milky Way-mass haloes and cluster-mass haloes in high-resolution, zoom-in, $N$-body simulations. We find that when subhaloes are excluded the median value of (1) $c_{\\rm{NFW}}$ is enhanced by $\\approx 38 \\pm 12\\%$ and $\\approx 88 \\pm 7.7\\%$ for Milky Way mass ($10^{12.1}\\,\\text{M}_\\odot$) and cluster mass ($10^{14.8}\\,\\text{M}_\\odot$) haloes respectively, (2) $λ_{\\rm Bullock}$ is reduced for Milky Way mass by $\\approx 16 \\pm 6.8\\%$ and cluster mass haloes by $\\approx 32 \\pm 8.9\\%$. Additionally, with the removal of subhaloes, cluster mass haloes tend to become more spherical as the ratio of minor-to-major axis, $c/a$, increases by $\\approx 12 \\pm 4\\%$, whereas Milky Way mass haloes remain approximately the same shape with $c/a$ changed by $\\approx 1.2 \\pm 5.6\\%$. The fractional change of each of these properties depends primarily on the amount of mass that is removed from the halo system and, to a lesser extent, mass accretion history. Our findings demonstrate that the properties of the smooth components of <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> haloes are biased relative to the total mass of the halo including subhaloes.\n",
      "30        In order to test active galactic nucleus (AGN) unification and evolutionary models, we measured the AGN clustering properties as a function of AGN obscuration defined in terms of hydrogen column density, $N_{\\rm H}$. In addition to measuring the clustering of unobscured ($N_{\\rm H} &lt; 10^{22}\\,{\\rm cm}^{-2}$) and moderately obscured ($10^{22} \\leq N_{\\rm H} &lt; 10^{23.5}$) AGNs, we also targeted highly obscured sources ($N_{\\rm H}\\geq 10^{23.5}$) up to redshifts of $z=3$. We have compiled one of the largest samples of X-ray-selected AGNs from a total of eight deep XMM/Chandra surveys. We measured the clustering as a function of both AGN obscuration and redshift using the projected two-point correlation function, $w_{\\rm p}(r_{\\rm p})$. We modeled the large-scale clustering signal, measured the AGN bias, $b(z, N_{\\rm H})$, and interpreted it in terms of the typical AGN host <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halo, $M_{\\rm halo}(z, N_{\\rm H}$). We find no significant dependence of AGN clustering on obscuration, suggesting similar typical masses of the hosting halos as a function of $N_{\\rm H}$. This result matches expectations of AGN unification models, in which AGN obscuration depends mainly on the viewing angle of the obscuring torus. We measured, for the first time, the clustering of highly obscured AGNs and find that these objects reside in halos with typical mass $\\log M_{\\rm halo} = 12.98_{-0.22}^{+0.17} [h^{-1} M_\\odot]$ ($12.28_{-0.19}^{+0.13}$) at low $z \\sim 0.7$ (high $z \\sim 1.8$) redshifts. We find that irrespective of obscuration, an increase in AGN bias with redshift is slower than the expectation for a constant halo mass and instead follows the growth rate of halos, known as the passive evolution track. This implies that for those AGNs the clustering is mainly driven by the mass growth rate of the hosting halos and galaxies across cosmic time.\n",
      "31        Mergers between galaxy clusters are an important stage in the formation of the large-scale structure of the Universe. Some of the mergers show a spectacular bow shock that formed as a result of recent passage of a smaller cluster through a bigger one, the classic example of this being the so-called bullet cluster. In this paper, I describe ten examples of interacting clusters identified among 200 of the most massive objects, with total masses above $1.4 \\times 10^{14}$ M$_{\\odot}$, from the IllustrisTNG300 simulation by searching for prominent bow shocks in their temperature maps. Despite different mass ratios of the two merging clusters, the events are remarkably similar in many respects. In all cases, the companion cluster passed close to the main one only once, between 0.9 and 0.3 Gyr ago, with the pericenter distance of 100-530 kpc and a velocity of up to 3400 km s$^{-1}$. The subcluster, typically an order of magnitude smaller in mass than the main cluster before the interaction, loses most of its <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> and gas in the process. The displacement between the collisionless part of the remnant and the bow shock is such that the remnant typically lags behind the shock or coincides with it, with a single exception of the merger occurring with the largest velocity. Usually about 1% of the gas cells in the merging clusters are shocked, and the median Mach numbers of these gas cells are around two. Due to the relatively small size of the simulation box, no close analog of the bullet cluster was found, but I identified one case that is similar in terms of mass, velocity, and displacement. The presented cases bear more resemblance to less extreme observed interacting clusters such as A520 and Coma.\n",
      "32        Microscopic horizonless relics could form in the early universe either directly through gravitational collapse or as stable remnants of the Hawking evaporation of primordial black holes. In both cases they completely or partially evade cosmological constraints arising from Hawking evaporation and in certain mass ranges can explain the entirety of the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>. We systematically explore the stochastic gravitational-wave background associated with the formation of microscopic <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span>-<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> relics in various scenarios, adopting an agnostic approach and discussing the limitations introduced by existing constraints, possible ways to circumvent the latter, and expected astrophysical foregrounds.

      "33        In direct <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> (DM) detection via scattering off the electrons, the momentum transfer plays a crucial role. Previous work showed that for self-interacting DM, if the DM particle has a size (the so-called puffy DM), the radius effect could dominate the momentum transfer and become another source of velocity dependence for self-scattering cross section. In this work we investigate the direct detection of puffy DM particles with different radii through electron recoil. We find that comparing with the available experimental exclusion limits dominated by the mediator effect for XENON10, XENON100 and XENON1T, the constraints on the puffy DM-electron scattering cross-section become much weaker for large radius DM particles. For small-radius DM particles, the constraints remain similar to the point-like DM case.\n",
      "34        Boson stars are gravitationally bound objects that arise in ultralight <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> models and form in the centers of galactic halos or axion miniclusters. We systematically study the excitations of a boson star, taking into account the mixing between positive and negative frequencies introduced by gravity. We show that the spectrum contains zero-energy modes in the monopole and dipole sectors resulting from spontaneous symmetry breaking by the boson star background. We analyze the general properties of the eigenmodes and derive their orthogonality and completeness conditions which have non-standard form due to the positive-negative frequency mixing. The eigenvalue problem is solved numerically for the first few energy levels in different multipole sectors and the results are compared to the solutions of the Schrödinger equation in fixed boson star gravitational potential. The two solutions differ significantly for the lowest modes, but get close for higher levels. We further confirm the normal mode spectrum in 3D wave simulations where we inject perturbations with different multipoles. As an application of the normal mode solutions, we compute the matrix element entering the evaporation rate of a boson star immersed in a hot axion gas. The computation combines the use of exact wavefunctions for the low-lying bound states and of the Schrödinger approximation for the high-energy excitations.\n",
      "35        If long-range attractive forces exist and are stronger than gravity then cosmic halo formation can begin in the radiation-dominated era. We study a simple realization of this effect in a system where <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> fermions have Yukawa interactions mediated by scalar particles, analogous to the Higgs boson in the standard model. We develop a self-consistent description of the system including exact background dynamics of the scalar field, and precise modelling of the fermion density fluctuations. For the latter, we provide accurate approximations for the linear growth as well as quantitative modelling of the nonlinear evolution using N-body simulations. We find that halo formation occurs exponentially fast and on scales substantially larger than simple estimates predict. The final fate of these halos remains uncertain, but could be annihilation, <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> stars, primordial black holes, or even the existence of galaxy-sized halos at <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>-radiation equality. More generally, our results demonstrate the importance of mapping scalar-mediated interactions onto structure formation outcomes and constraints for beyond the standard model theories.\n",
      "36        Recent analysis on the stellar kinematics of ultra-faint dwarf (UFD) galaxies has put a stringent upper limit on the self-scattering cross section of <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>, i.e., $σ/m&lt;{\\cal O}(0.1)\\,{\\rm cm^2/g}$ at the scattering velocity of ${\\cal O}(10)\\,{\\rm km/s}$. Resonant self-interacting <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> (rSIDM) is one possibility that can be consistent with the UFDs and explain the low central densities of rotation-supported galaxies; the cross section is resonantly enhanced to be $σ/m = {\\cal O}(1)\\,{\\rm cm^2/g}$ around the scattering velocity of ${\\cal O}(100)\\,{\\rm km/s}$ while being suppressed at lower velocities. To further assess this possibility, since the inferred <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> distribution of halos from astrophysical observations is usually compared to that in constant-cross section SIDM (cSIDM), whether the structures of rSIDM halos can be approximated by the cSIDM halo profiles needs to be clarified. In this work, we employ the grovothermal fluid method to investigate the structural evolution of rSIDM halos in a wide mass range. We find that except for halos in a specific mass range, the present structures of rSIDM halos are virtually indistinguishable from those of the cSIDM halos. For halos in the specific mass range, the resonant self-scattering renders a break in their density profile. We demonstrate how such a density-profile break appears in astrophysical observations, e.g., rotation curves and line-of-sight velocity dispersion profiles. We show that for halos above the specific mass range, the density-profile break thermalizes to disappear before the present. We demonstrate that such distinctive thermalization dynamics can leave imprints on the orbital classes of stars with similar ages and metallicities.\n",
      "37        The E-type $α$-attractor models of single-field inflation were generalized further in order to accommodate production of primordial black holes (PBH) via adding a near-inflection point to the inflaton scalar potential at smaller scales, in good agreement with measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation. A minimal number of new parameters was used but their fine-tuning was maximized in order to increase possible masses of PBH formed during an ultra-slow-roll phase leading to a large enhancement of the power spectrum of scalar (curvature) perturbations by 6 or 7 orders of magnitude against the power spectrum of perturbations observed in CMB. It was found that extreme fine-tuning of the parameters in our models can lead to a formation of the Earth-size PBH with the masses of approximately $10^{27}$ g, still in agreement with CMB observations. Quantum corrections are known to lead to the perturbative upper bound on the amplitude of large scalar perturbations responsible for PBH production. The quantum (one-loop) corrections in our models were found to be suppressed by one order of magnitude for PBH with the masses of approximately $10^{19}$ g, which may form the whole <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> in the Universe.\n",
      "38        We discuss in detail the possibility that the &#34;type-II majoron&#34; -- that is, the pseudo Nambu-Goldstone boson that arises in the context of the type-II seesaw mechanism if the lepton number is spontaneously broken by an additional singlet scalar -- account for the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> (DM) observed in the universe. We study the requirements the model&#39;s parameters have to fulfill in order to reproduce the measured DM relic abundance through two possible production mechanisms in the early universe, freeze-in and misalignment, both during a standard radiation-dominated era and early <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> domination. We then study possible signals of type-II majoron DM and the present and expected constraints on the parameter space that can be obtained from cosmological observations, direct detection experiments, and present and future searches for decaying DM at neutrino telescopes and cosmic-ray experiments. We find that -- depending on the majoron mass, the production mechanism, and the value of the vacuum expectation value of the type-II triplet -- all of the three decay modes (photons, electrons, neutrinos) of majoron DM particles can yield observable signals at future indirect searches for DM. Furthermore, in a corner of the parameter space, detection of majoron DM is possible through electron recoil at running and future direct detection experiments.\n",
      "39        Running vacuum models and viscous <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> scenarios beyond perfect fluid idealization are two appealing theoretical strategies that have been separately studied as alternatives to solve some problems rooted in the $Λ$CDM cosmological model. In this paper, we combine these two notions in a single cosmological setting and investigate their cosmological implications, paying particular attention in the interplay between these two constituents in different cosmological periods. Specifically, we consider a well-studied running vacuum model inspired by renormalization group, and a recently proposed general parameterization for the bulk viscosity $ξ$. By employing dynamical system analysis, we explore the physical aspects of the new phase space that emerges from the combined models and derive stability conditions that ensure complete cosmological dynamics. We identify four distinct classes of models and find that the critical points of the phase space are non-trivially renewed compared to the single scenarios. We then proceed, in a joint and complementary way to the dynamical system analysis, with a detailed numerical exploration to quantify the impact of both the running parameter and the bulk viscosity coefficient on the cosmological evolution. Thus, for some values of the model parameters, numerical solutions show qualitative differences from the $Λ$CDM model, which is phenomenologically appealing in light of cosmological observations.\n",
      "40        The intrinsic alignment (IA) of observed galaxy shapes with the underlying cosmic web is a source of contamination in weak lensing surveys. Sensitive methods to identify the IA signal will therefore need to be included in the upcoming weak lensing analysis pipelines. Hydrodynamical cosmological simulations allow us to directly measure the intrinsic ellipticities of galaxies and thus provide a powerful approach to predict and understand the IA signal. Here we employ the novel, large-volume hydrodynamical simulation MTNG740, a product of the MillenniumTNG (MTNG) project, to study the IA of galaxies. We measure the projected correlation functions between the intrinsic shape/shear of galaxies and various tracers of large-scale structure, $w_{+g},\\ w_{+m},\\ w_{++}$ over the radial range $r_{\\rm p} \\in [0.02 , 200]\\,h^{-1}{\\rm Mpc}$ and at redshifts $z=0.0$, $0.5$ and $1.0$. We detect significant signal-to-noise IA signals with the density field for both elliptical and spiral galaxies. We also find significant intrinsic shear-shear correlations for ellipticals. We further examine correlations of the intrinsic shape of galaxies with the local tidal field. Here we find a significant IA signal for elliptical galaxies assuming a linear model. We also detect a weak IA signal for spiral galaxies under a quadratic tidal torquing model. Lastly, we measure the alignment between central galaxies and their host <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span>-<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halos, finding small to moderate misalignments between their principal axes that decline with halo mass.\n",
      "41        We study weak gravitational lensing convergence maps produced from the MillenniumTNG (MTNG) simulations by direct projection of the mass distribution on the past backwards lightcone of a fiducial observer. We explore the lensing maps over a large dynamic range in simulation mass and angular resolution, allowing us to establish a clear assessment of numerical convergence. By comparing full physics hydrodynamical simulations with corresponding <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span>-<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>-only runs we quantify the impact of baryonic physics on the most important weak lensing statistics. Likewise, we predict the impact of massive neutrinos reliably far into the non-linear regime. We also demonstrate that the &#34;fixed &amp; paired&#34; variance suppression technique increases the statistical robustness of the simulation predictions on large scales not only for time slices but also for continuously output lightcone data. We find that both baryonic and neutrino effects substantially impact weak lensing shear measurements, with the latter dominating over the former on large angular scales. Thus, both effects must explicitly be included to obtain sufficiently accurate predictions for stage IV lensing surveys. Reassuringly, our results agree accurately with other simulation results where available, supporting the promise of simulation modelling for precision cosmology far into the non-linear regime.\n",
      "42        An era of kination occurs when the Universe&#39;s energy density is dominated by a fast-rolling scalar field. <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">Dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> that is thermally produced during an era of kination requires larger-than-canonical annihilation cross sections to generate the observed <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> relic abundance. Furthermore, <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> density perturbations that enter the horizon during an era of kination grow linearly with the scale factor prior to radiation domination. We show how the resulting enhancement to the small-scale <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> power spectrum increases the microhalo abundance and boosts the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> annihilation rate. We then use gamma-ray observations to constrain thermal <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> production during kination. The annihilation boost factor depends on the minimum halo mass, which is determined by the small-scale cutoff in the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> power spectrum. Therefore, observational limits on the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> annihilation rate imply a minimum cutoff scale for a given <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> particle mass and kination scenario. For <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> that was once in thermal equilibrium with the Standard Model, this constraint establishes a maximum allowed kinetic decoupling temperature for the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>. This bound on the decoupling temperature implies that the growth of perturbations during kination cannot appreciably boost the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> annihilation rate if <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> was once in thermal equilibrium with the Standard Model.\n",
      "43        We present the measurement of total and stellar/<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> decomposed mass density profile around a sample of galaxy groups and clusters with dynamical masses derived from integral-field stellar kinematics from the MaNGA survey in Paper~I and weak lensing derived from the DECaLS imaging survey. Combining the two data sets enables accurate measurement of the radial density distribution from several kpc to Mpc scales. Intriguingly, we find that the excess surface density derived from stellar kinematics in the inner region cannot be explained by simply adding an NFW <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halo extrapolated from lensing measurement at a larger scale to a stellar mass component derived from the NASA-Sloan Atlas (NSA) catalog. We find that a good fit to both data sets requires a stellar mass normalization about 3 times higher than that derived from the NSA catalog, which would require an unrealistically too-heavy initial mass function for stellar mass estimation. If we keep the stellar mass normalization to that of the NSA catalog but allow a varying inner <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> density profile, we obtain an asymptotic slope of $γ_{\\rm gnfw}$= $1.82_{-0.25}^{+0.15}$, $γ_{\\rm gnfw}$= $1.48_{-0.41}^{+0.20}$ for the group bin and the cluster bin respectively, significantly steeper than the NFW case. We also compare the total mass inner density slopes with those from Illustris-TNG300 and find that the values from the simulation are lower than the observation by at least $3σ$ level.\n",
      "44        We present dynamical scaling relations, combined with the stellar population properties, for a subsample of about 6000 nearby galaxies with the most reliable dynamical models extracted from the full MaNGA sample of 10K galaxies. We show that the inclination-corrected mass plane (MP) for both early-type galaxies (ETGs) and late-type galaxies (LTGs), which links dynamical mass, projected half-light radius $R_{\\rm e}$, and the second stellar velocity moment $σ_{\\rm e}$ within $R_{\\rm e}$, satisfies the virial theorem and is even tighter than the uncorrected one. We find a clear parabolic relation between $\\lg(M/L)(&lt;R_{\\rm e})$, the total mass-to-light ratio within a sphere of radius $R_{\\rm e}$, and $\\lgσ_{\\rm e}$, with the $M/L$ increasing with $σ_{\\rm e}$ and for older stellar populations. However, the relation for ETGs is linear and the one for the youngest galaxies is constant. We confirm and improve the relation between average logarithmic total density slopes $γ_{_{\\rm T}}$ and $σ_{\\rm e}$: $γ_{_{\\rm T}}$ become steeper with increasing $σ_{\\rm e}$ until $\\lg(σ_{\\rm e}/{\\rm km\\,s^{-1}})\\approx 2.2$ and then remain constant around $γ_{_{\\rm T}}\\approx -2.2$. The $γ_{_{\\rm T}}-σ_{\\rm e}$ variation is larger for LTGs than ETGs. At fixed $σ_{\\rm e}$ the total density profiles steepen with galaxy age and for ETGs. We find generally low <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> fractions, median $f_{\\rm DM}(&lt;R_{\\rm e})=8$ per cent, within a sphere of radius $R_{\\rm e}$. However, we find that $f_{\\rm DM}(&lt;R_{\\rm e})$ depends on $σ_{\\rm e}$ better than stellar mass: <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> increases to a median $f_{\\rm DM}=33$ percent for galaxies with $σ_{\\rm e}\\lesssim100{\\rm km\\,s^{-1}}$. The increased $f_{\\rm DM}(&lt;R_{\\rm e})$ at low $σ_{\\rm e}$ explains the parabolic $\\lg(M/L)(&lt;R_{\\rm e})-\\lgσ_{\\rm e}$ relation.\n",
      "45        We analyze the global stellar population, radial gradients and non-parametric star formation history of $\\sim 10$K galaxies from the MaNGA Survey final data release 17 (DR17), based on stellar population synthesis and full-spectrum fitting, and relate them with dynamical properties of galaxies. We confirm that stellar population correlates with stellar velocity dispersion $σ_{\\rm e}$ better than with stellar mass $M_{\\ast}$, but also find that younger galaxies are more metal-poor at fixed $σ_{\\rm e}$. Stellar age, metallicity, and mass-to-light ratio $M_{\\ast}/L$ all decrease with galaxy rotation, while radial gradients become more negative (i.e., younger, more metal-poor, and lower $M_{\\ast}/L$ in the outskirts). The trend between metallicity gradients and rotation reverses for slow rotators, which stand out for their more negative metallicity gradients than faster-rotating galaxies. We highlight a population of massive disk galaxies on the green valley, on the $(σ_{\\rm e},\\rm Age)$ plane, that show steep negative age and metallicity gradients, consistent with their old central bulges surrounded by young star-forming disks and metal-poor gas accretion. Galaxies with high $σ_{\\rm e}$, steep total mass-density slope, low <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> fraction, high $M_{\\ast}/L$, and high metallicity have the highest star-formation rate at earlier times, and are currently quenched.

      "46        This is the first paper in our series on the combined analysis of the Dynamics and stellar Population (DynPop) for the MaNGA survey in the final SDSS Data Release 17 (DR17). Here we present a catalogue of dynamically-determined quantities for over 10000 nearby galaxies based on integral-field stellar kinematics from the MaNGA survey. The dynamical properties are extracted using the axisymmetric Jeans Anisotropic Modelling (JAM) method, which was previously shown to be the most accurate for this kind of study. We assess systematic uncertainties using eight dynamical models with different assumptions. We use two orientations of the velocity ellipsoid: either cylindrically-aligned JAM$_{\\rm cyl}$ or spherically-aligned JAM$_{\\rm sph}$. We also make four assumptions for the models&#39; <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> vs. luminous <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> distributions: (1) mass-follows-light, (2) free NFW <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> halo, (3) cosmologically-constrained NFW halo, (4) generalized NFW <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> halo, i.e. with free inner slope. In this catalogue, we provide the quantities related to the mass distributions (e.g. the density slopes and enclosed mass within a sphere of a given radius for total mass, stellar mass, and <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> mass components). We also provide the complete models which can be used to compute the full luminous and mass distribution of each galaxy. Additionally, we visually assess the qualities of the models to help with model selections. We estimate the observed scatter in the measured quantities which decreases as expected with improvements in quality. For the best data quality, we find a remarkable consistency of measured quantities between different models, highlighting the robustness of the results.\n",
      "47        What is the highest energy at which gravitons can be observed? We address this question by studying graviton-to-photon conversion - the inverse-Gertsenshtein effect - in the magnetic field of the Milky Way. We find that above $\\sim 1~\\mbox{PeV}$ the effective photon mass grows large enough to quench the conversion rate. The induced photon flux is comparable to the sensitivity of LHAASO to a diffuse $γ$-ray background, but only for graviton abundances of order $Ω_{\\text{gw}} h^2_0 \\sim 1$. In the future, owing to a better understanding of $γ$-ray backgrounds, larger effective areas and longer observation times, sub-PeV shimmering gravitons with a realistic abundance of $Ω_{\\text{gw}} h^2_0 \\sim 0.01$ could be detected. We show that this is achieved in a cosmologically-motivated scenario of post-recombination superheavy <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> decay. Therefore, the sub-PeV range might be the ultimate energy frontier at which gravitons can be observed.\n",
      "48        The relation between the total mass contained in the globular clusters of a galaxy and the mass of its <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halo has been found observationally to be nearly linear over five decades of mass. However, the high-mass end of this relation is not well determined from previous data and shows large scatter. We analyze the globular cluster systems (GCSs) of a homogeneous sample of 11 brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) through DOLPHOT photometry of their deep Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images in the F814W filter. We standardize the definition of $M_{GCS}$, the total GCS mass, by using the GC total population within a limiting radius of $0.1 R_{virial}$, while the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span>-<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halo mass $M_h$ is determined from the weak-lensing calibration of $M_h$ versus $M_{bary}$. When these 11 BCGs are added to the previously studied homogeneous catalogue of Virgo member galaxies, a total value for $η= M_{GCS}/M_h$ is found to be $(3.0\\pm1.8_{internal})\\times10^{-5}$, slightly higher than previous estimates but with much reduced uncertainty. Perhaps more importantly, the results suggest that the relation continues to have a near-linear shape at the highest galaxy masses, strongly reinforcing the conclusion that accreted GCs make a major contribution to the GC populations at high galaxy mass.\n",
      "49        We introduce an analytic surface density profile for <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halos that accurately reproduces the structure of simulated halos of mass $M_{\\rm vir} = 10^{7-11}\\ M_\\odot$, making it useful for modeling line-of-sight perturbers in strong gravitational lensing models. The two-parameter function has an analytic deflection potential and is more accurate than the projected Navarro, Frenk &amp; White (NFW) profile commonly adopted at this mass scale for perturbers, especially at the small radii of most relevant for lensing perturbations. Using a characteristic radius, $R_{-1}$, where the log slope of surface density is equal to $-1$, and an associated surface density, $Σ_{-1}$, we can represent the expected lensing signal from line-of-sight halos statistically, for an ensemble of halo orientations, using a distribution of {\\em projected concentration} parameters, $\\mathcal{C}_{\\rm vir} := r_{\\rm vir}/ R_{-1}$. Though an individual halo can have a projected concentration that varies with orientation with respect to the observer, the range of projected concentrations correlates with the usual three-dimensional halo concentration in a way that enables ease of use.\n",

We search for Lyman-break dropout-selected galaxies using HST WFC3/ACS broadband imaging in the fields of three $6 &lt; z &lt; 7$ quasars, as well as their simultaneously observed coordinated-parallel fields, and constrain their photometric redshifts using EAZY. One field, J0305-3150, shows a volume density 10$\\times$ higher than the blank-field UV luminosity function (UVLF) at M$_{UV} &lt; -20$, with tentative evidence of a 3$σ$ overdensity in its parallel field located 15 cMpc away. Another field, J2054-0005, shows an angular overdensity within 500 ckpc from the quasar but still consistent with UVLF predictions within 3$σ$, while the last field, J2348-3054, shows no enhancement. We discuss methods for reducing uncertainty in overdensity measurements when using photometric selection and show that we can robustly select LBGs consistent with being physically associated with the quasar, corroborated by existing JWST/NIRCam WFSS data in the J0305 field. Even accounting for incompleteness, the overdensities in J0305 and J2054 are higher for brighter galaxies at short angular separations, suggesting preferential enhancement of more massive galaxies in the immediate vicinity of the quasar. Finally, we compare the LBG population with previously-identified [CII] and mm-continuum companions; the LBG overdensities are not accompanied by an enhanced number of dusty galaxies, suggesting that the overdense quasar fields are not in the bursty star-forming phase sometimes seen in high-redshift protoclusters.\n"

The effects of DM on NS properties, including the mass-radius relation, the moment of inertia, and tidal deformability, are calculated by varying its fraction. The study found that the EOS becomes softer with increasing DM momentum, and the DM has marginal effects on nuclear <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> properties, except for the EOSs and binding energy per particle. The study also calculated the properties of isolated, static, and rotating DM admixed NS and found that the DM has significant effects on both static and rotating NS. We have also observed that a tiny amount of DM can accumulate inside the NS, and more amount of it makes the NS unstable. The study also suggests that the secondary component might be a NS with DM content if the underlying nuclear EOS is sufficiently stiff. The $f$-mode oscillations of the DM admixed hyperon stars are calculated and found that there exist a correlation between canonical $f$-mode frequency and the dimensionless tidal deformability parameter ($Λ_{1.4}$) and we have put a constraint on $f$-mode frequency using GW170817 data. Finally, we have calculated the DM admixed binary NS properties and found that the binary system becomes less deformed and sustains more time in its inspiral phases with the addition of DM. Therefore, we suggest that one can take DM inside the compact objects while modeling the inspiral waveforms for the BNS systems.\n",

However, such ``<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span>&#39;&#39; systems have a poorly known level of magnetic turbulence, which determines the residence time of the electrons and positrons and therefore also the strength of the expected signal. This typically leads to significant uncertainties in the derived DM bounds. In a novel approach, we compute the self-confinement of the DM-induced electrons and positrons. Indeed, they themselves generate irregularities in the magnetic field, thus setting a lower limit on the presence of the magnetic turbulence. We specifically apply this approach to dwarf spheroidal galaxies. Finally, by comparing the expected synchrotron emission with radio data from the direction of the Draco galaxy collected at the Giant Metre Radio Telescope, we show that the proposed approach can be used to set robust and competitive bounds on WIMP DM.\n",

In particular, the flux of cosmic positrons has been measured with high precision by the AMS-02 experiment demonstrating that an excess above 10 GeV, with respect to the secondary production, is present. We study in this paper the possible DM origin of the positron excess finding the values of the DM mass $M$ and annihilation cross section $\\langle σv \\rangle$ that are needed to fit high-energy positron data. In particular, we find that for DM annihilating into $b\\bar{b}$ it is required to have $M=43$ TeV and $\\langle σv \\rangle = 10^{-21}$ cm$^3$/s while for $τ^+τ^-$ $M=2$ TeV and $\\langle σv \\rangle = 3\\times 10^{-23}$ cm$^3$/s. If DM produce positrons, they are expected to generate gamma rays from the center of the Milky Way and around dwarf galaxy satellites of the Galaxy. We thus combine the values for the DM mass and annihilation cross section obtained with the fit to AMS-02 positron data with the upper limits derived with the non-detection of $γ$ rays with HESS in the direction of the Galactic center and Fermi-LAT for the combined analysis of dwarf galaxies. The main result of the paper is that only DM annihilating into $μ^+ μ^-$ with a mass around 500 GeV and $\\langle σv \\rangle = 4\\times 10^{-24}$ cm$^3$/s can fit AMS-02 data and be compatible with the upper limits found with $γ$ rays. As for the $τ^+ τ^-$ ($b\\bar{b}$) channel, DM can contribute at most at a few tens $\\%$ (a few \\%) level.\n",

We study a semi-analytical subhalo model for interacting <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> with radiation, based on the extended Press-Schechter formalism and subhalos&#39; tidal evolution prescription. We also test the elastic scattering between DM and neutrinos using observations of Milky-Way satellites from the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">Dark</span> Energy Survey and PanSTARRS1. We conservatively impose strong constraints on the DM-neutrino scattering cross section of $σ_{{\\rm DM}\\text{-}ν,n}\\propto E_ν^n$ $(n=0,2,4)$ at $95\\%$ confidence level (CL), $σ_{{\\rm DM}\\text{-}ν,0}&lt; 10^{-32}\\ {\\rm cm^2}\\ (m_{\\rm DM}/{\\rm GeV})$, $σ_{{\\rm DM}\\text{-}ν,2}&lt; 10^{-43}\\ {\\rm cm^2}\\ (m_{\\rm DM}/{\\rm GeV})(E_ν/E_ν^0)^2$ and $σ_{{\\rm DM}\\text{-}ν,4}&lt; 10^{-54}\\ {\\rm cm^2}\\ (m_{\\rm DM}/{\\rm GeV})(E_ν/E_ν^0)^4$, where $E_ν^0$ is the average momentum of relic cosmic neutrinos today, $E_ν^0 \\simeq 3.15 T_ν^0 \\simeq 6.1\\ {\\rm K}$. By imposing a satellite forming condition, we obtain the strongest upper bounds on the DM-neutrino cross section at $95\\%$ CL, $σ_{{\\rm DM}\\text{-}ν,0}&lt; 4\\times 10^{-34}\\ {\\rm cm^2}\\ (m_{\\rm DM}/{\\rm GeV})$, $σ_{{\\rm DM}\\text{-}ν,2}&lt; 10^{-46}\\ {\\rm cm^2}\\ (m_{\\rm DM}/{\\rm GeV})(E_ν/E_ν^0)^2$ and $σ_{{\\rm DM}\\text{-}ν,4}&lt; 7\\times 10^{-59}\\ {\\rm cm^2}\\ (m_{\\rm DM}/{\\rm GeV})(E_ν/E_ν^0)^4$.\n",
      "6        Numerous observations suggest that there exist undiscovered beyond-the-Standard-Model particles and fields. Because of their unknown nature, these exotic particles and fields could interact with Standard Model particles in many different ways and assume a variety of possible configurations. Here we present an overview of the Global Network of Optical Magnetometers for Exotic physics searches (GNOME), our ongoing experimental program designed to test a wide range of exotic physics scenarios. The GNOME experiment utilizes a worldwide network of shielded atomic magnetometers (and, more recently, comagnetometers) to search for spatially and temporally correlated signals due to torques on atomic spins from exotic fields of astrophysical origin. We survey the temporal characteristics of a variety of possible signals currently under investigation such as those from topological defect <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> (axion-like particle domain walls), axion-like particle stars, solitons of complex-valued scalar fields (Q-balls), stochastic fluctuations of bosonic <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> fields, a solar axion-like particle halo, and bursts of ultralight bosonic fields produced by cataclysmic astrophysical events such as binary black hole mergers.\n",
      "7        Recent observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) are yielding tantalizing hints of an early population of massive, bright galaxies at $z &gt; 10$, with Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) observations indicating significant dust masses in place as early as $z\\sim 7$. To understand the implications of these observations, we use the DELPHI semi-analytic model that jointly tracks the assembly of <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halos and their constituent baryons, including the key processes of dust enrichment. Our model employs only two redshift- and mass-independent free parameters that are tuned against all available galaxy data at $z \\sim 5-9$ before it is used to make predictions up to $z \\sim 20$. Our key results are: (1) the model progressively under-predicts the observed ultraviolet luminosity function (UV LF) at $z &gt; 12$; observations at $z&gt;16$ lie close to, or even above, a &#34;maximal&#34; model where all available gas is turned into stars; (2) UV selection would miss 34% of the star formation rate density at $z \\sim 5$, decreasing to 17% by $z \\sim 10$ for bright galaxies with $\\rm{M_{UV}} &lt; -19$; (3) the dust mass ($M_d$) evolves with the stellar mass ($M_*$) and redshift as $\\log(M_d) = 1.194\\log(M_*) + 0.0975z - 5.433$; (4) the escape fraction of UV photons ($f_{\\rm esc}^{\\rm UV}$) decreases with increasing mass and star formation rate. At $z \\sim 7$, $f_{\\rm esc}^{\\rm UV} \\sim 0.8~(0.1)$ for $M_* \\sim 10^9~ (10^{11}) \\, M_\\odot$ galaxies; (5) the dust temperature increases with stellar mass, ranging between $30-33$ K for $M_* \\sim 10^{9-11}M_\\odot$ galaxies at $z \\sim 7$. Finally, we predict the far infrared (FIR) LF at $z \\sim 5-20$, testable with ALMA observations, and caution that spectroscopic redshifts and dust masses must be pinned down before invoking unphysical extrema in galaxy formation models.\n",
      "8        We reexamine the consequences of perturbative unitarity on <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> freeze-out when both Sommerfeld enhancement and bound state formation affect <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> annihilations. At leading order (LO) the annihilation cross-section is infrared dominated and the connection between the unitarity bound and the upper bound on the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> mass depends only on how the different partial waves are populated. We compute how this picture is modified at next-to-leading order (NLO) with the goal of assigning a reliable theory uncertainty to the freeze-out predictions. We explicitly compute NLO corrections in a simple model with abelian gauge interactions and provide an estimate of the theoretical uncertainty for the thermal masses of heavy electroweak $n$-plets. Along the way, we clarify the regularization and matching procedure necessary to deal with singular potentials in quantum mechanics with a calculable relativistic UV completion.\n",
      "9        We provide an algorithm for evolving general spin-$s$ Gross-Pitaevskii / non-linear Schrödinger systems carrying a variety of interactions, where the $2s+1$ components of the `spinor&#39; field represent the different spin-multiplicity states. We consider many nonrelativistic interactions up to quartic order in the Schrödinger field (both short and long-range, and spin-dependent and spin-independent interactions), including explicit spin-orbit couplings. The algorithm allows for spatially varying external and/or self-generated vector potentials that couple to the spin density of the field. Our work can be used for scenarios ranging from laboratory systems such as spinor Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs), to cosmological/astrophysical systems such as self-interacting bosonic <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>. As examples, we provide results for two different setups of spin-$1$ BECs that employ a varying magnetic field and spin-orbit coupling, respectively, and also collisions of spin-$1$ solitons in <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>. Our symplectic algorithm is second-order accurate in time, and is extensible to the known higher-order accurate methods.\n",
      "10        We discuss the production of primordial black holes in an early <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> dominated era, which typically takes place in string inspired early universe cosmological models. In particular, we consider a pre-big bang scenario (extending previous results regarding formation in the radiation dominated era) where the enhancement of curvature perturbations is induced by a variation of the sound-speed parameter c_s during the string phase of high-curvature inflation. After imposing all relevant observational constraints, we find that the considered class of models is compatible with the production of a large amount of primordial black holes, in the mass range relevant to <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>, only for a small range of the parameters space. On the other hand, we find that a huge production of light primordial black holes may occur both in such <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> dominated era and in the radiation dominated one.\n",
      "11        We explore an extension of the standard $Λ$CDM model by including an interaction between neutrinos and <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>, and making use of the ground based telescope data of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT). An indication for a non-zero coupling between <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> and neutrinos (both assuming a temperature independent and $T^2$ dependent cross-section) is obtained at the 1$σ$ level coming from the ACT CMB data alone and when combined with the Planck CMB and Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) measurements. This result is confirmed by both fixing the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom in the early Universe to the Standard Model value of $N_{\\rm eff}=3.044$, and allowing $N_{\\rm eff}$ to be a free cosmological parameter. Furthermore, when performing a Bayesian model comparison, the interacting $ν$DM (+$N_{\\rm eff}$) scenario is mostly preferred over a baseline $Λ$CDM (+$N_{\\rm eff}$) cosmology. The preferred value is then used as a benchmark and the potential implications of <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter&#39;s</span> interaction with a sterile neutrino are discussed.\n",
      "12        We present an innovative approach to constraining the non-cold <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> model using a convolutional neural network (CNN). We perform a suite of hydrodynamic simulations with varying <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> particle masses and generate mock 21cm radio intensity maps to trace the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> distribution. Our proposed method complements the traditional power spectrum analysis. We compare our CNN classification results with those from the power spectrum of the differential brightness temperature map of 21cm radiation, and find that the CNN outperforms the latter. Moreover, we investigate the impact of baryonic physics on the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> model constraint, including star formation, self-shielding of HI gas, and UV background model. We find that these effects may introduce some contamination in the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> constraint, but they are insignificant when compared to the realistic system noise of the SKA instruments.\n",
      "13        The <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> power spectrum has been strongly constrained by astronomical measurements at large scales, but only weakly at small scales. Compared with the standard scenario, the deviation of the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> power spectrum at small scales has influence on the cosmological structure formation, e.g., the comoving number density of <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halos. The thermal history of the intergalactic medium (IGM) can be changed if <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> is made of weakly interacting massive particles and can annihilate into standard model particles. The changes of the evolution of IGM could leave imprints on the relevant astronomical observations. Taking into account the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> annihilation, we investigate the impact of the deviation of <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> power spectrum at small scales on the global 21-cm signal. In view of the measurements of the global 21-cm signal by the EDGES experiment, we explore the allowed parameter space of $m_s$, which describes the degree of deviation, by requiring the differential brightness temperature of the global 21-cm signal $δT_{21} \\le -50~\\rm mK$ at redshift $z=17$.\n",
      "14        Using Low Brightness Surface Galaxies (LBSG) rotational curves we inferred the free parameters of $\\ell$-boson stars as a <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> component. The $\\ell$-boson stars are numerical solutions to the non-relativistic limit of the Einstein-Klein-Gordon system, the Schrödinger-Poisson (SP) system. These solutions are parametrized by an angular momentum number $\\ell = (N-1)/2$ and an excitation number $n$. We perform a bayesian analysis by modifying the SimpleMC code to perform the parameter inference, for the cases with $\\ell = 0$, $\\ell = 1$ and multistates of $\\ell$-boson stars. We used the Akaike information criterion (AIC), Bayesian information criterion and the Bayes factor to compare the excited state ($\\ell$=1) and the multistate case with the ground state ($\\ell$=0) as the base model due to its simplicity. We found that the data in most galaxies in the sample favours the multistates case and that the scalar field mass tends to be slightly bigger than the ground state case.\n",
      "15        A long-standing observed curiosity of globular clusters (GCs) has been that both the number and total mass of GCs in a galaxy are linearly correlated with the galaxy&#39;s virial mass, whereas its stellar component shows no such linear correlation. This work expands on an empirical model for the numbers and ages of GCs in galaxies presented by Valenzuela et al. (2021) that is consistent with recent observational data from massive elliptical galaxies down to the dwarf galaxy regime. Applying the model to simulations, GC numbers are shown to be excellent tracers for the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> (DM) virial mass, even when distinct formation mechanisms are employed for blue and red GCs. Furthermore, the amount of DM smooth accretion is encoded in the GC abundances, therefore providing a measure for an otherwise nearly untraceable component of the formation history of galaxies.\n",
      "16        We analytically solve the problem of Bose star growth in the bath of gravitationally interacting particles. We find that after nucleation of this object, the bath is described by a self-similar solution of the kinetic equation, which is an attractor. Together with the conservation laws, this fixes mass evolution of the Bose star. Our results explain slowdown of the star growth at a certain &#34;core-halo&#34; mass, but also predict formation of the heavier and lighter objects in magistral <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> models.\n",
      "17        <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">Dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> subhaloes are key for the predictions of simulations of structure formation, but their existence frequently ends prematurely due to two technical issues, namely numerical disruption in N-body simulations and halo finders failing to identify them. Here we focus on the second issue, using the phase-space friends-of-friends halo finder ROCKSTAR as a benchmark (though we expect our results to translate to comparable codes). We confirm that the most prominent cause for losing track of subhaloes is tidal distortion rather than a low number of particles. As a solution, we present a flexible post-processing algorithm that tracks all subhalo particles over time, computes subhalo positions and masses based on those particles, and progressively removes stripped <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>. If a subhalo is lost by the halo finder, this algorithm keeps tracking its so-called ghost until it has almost no particles left or has truly merged with its host. We apply this technique to a large suite of N-body simulations and restore lost subhaloes to the halo catalogues, which has a dramatic effect on key summary statistics of large-scale structure. Specifically, the subhalo mass function increases by about 50% and the halo correlation function increases by a factor of two at small scales. While these quantitative results are somewhat specific to our algorithm, they demonstrate that particle tracking is a promising way to reliably follow haloes and reduce the need for orphan models. Our algorithm and augmented halo catalogues are publicly available.\n",
      "18        Ultralight bosons are predicted in many extensions to the Standard Model and are popular <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> candidates. The black hole superradiance mechanism allows for these particles to be probed using only their gravitational interaction. In this scenario, an ultralight boson cloud may form spontaneously around a spinning black hole and extract a non-negligible fraction of the black hole&#39;s mass. These oscillating clouds produce quasi-monochromatic, long-duration gravitational waves that may be detectable by ground-based or space-based gravitational wave detectors. We discuss the capability of a new long-duration signal tracking method, based on a hidden Markov model, to detect gravitational wave signals generated by ultralight vector boson clouds, including cases where the signal frequency evolution timescale is much shorter than that of a typical continuous wave signal. We quantify the detection horizon distances for vector boson clouds with current- and next-generation ground-based detectors. We demonstrate that vector clouds hosted by black holes with mass $\\gtrsim 60 M_{\\odot}$ and spin $\\gtrsim 0.6$ are within the reach of current-generation detectors up to a luminosity distance of $\\sim 1$ Gpc. This search method enables one to target vector boson clouds around remnant black holes from compact binary mergers detected by gravitational-wave detectors. We discuss the impact of the sky localization of the merger events and demonstrate that a typical remnant black hole reasonably well-localized by the current generation detector network is accessible in a follow-up search.\n",
      "19        Lithium-drifted silicon [Si(Li)] has been used for decades as an ionizing radiation detector in nuclear, particle, and astrophysical experiments, though such detectors have frequently been limited to small sizes (few cm$^2$) and cryogenic operating temperatures. The 10-cm-diameter Si(Li) detectors developed for the General Antiparticle Spectrometer (GAPS) balloon-borne <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> experiment are novel particularly for their requirements of low cost, large sensitive area (~10 m$^2$ for the full 1440-detector array), high temperatures (near -40$\\,^\\circ$C), and energy resolution below 4 keV FWHM for 20--100-keV x-rays. Previous works have discussed the manufacturing, passivation, and small-scale testing of prototype GAPS Si(Li) detectors. Here we show for the first time the results from detailed characterization of over 1100 flight detectors, illustrating the consistent intrinsic low-noise performance of a large sample of GAPS detectors. This work demonstrates the feasibility of large-area and low-cost Si(Li) detector arrays for next-generation astrophysics and nuclear physics applications.\n",

The boosted <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">Dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">Matter</span> flux at the edge of the Earth&#39;s atmosphere is expected to be pointing to the Galactic Center, with a flux 15 to 20 times larger than in the transverse direction.\n",
      "21        We investigate the reach of future gravitational wave (GW) detectors in probing inflaton couplings with visible sector particles that can either be bosonic or fermionic in nature. Assuming reheating takes place through perturbative quantum production from vacuum in presence of classical inflaton background field, we find that the spectral energy density of the primordial GW generated during inflation becomes sensitive to inflaton-<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> coupling. We conclude, obeying bounds from Big Bang Nucleosysthesis and Cosmic Microwave Background, that, e.g., inflaton-scalar couplings of the order of $\\sim\\mathcal{O}(10^{-20})$ GeV fall within the sensitivity range of several proposed GW detector facilities. However, this prediction is sensitive to the size of the inflationary scale, nature of the inflaton-<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> interaction and shape of the potential during reheating. Having found the time-dependent effective inflaton decay width, we also discuss its implications for <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> (DM) production from the thermal plasma via UV freeze-in during reheating. It is shown, that one can reproduce the observed DM abundance for its mass up to several PeVs, depending on the dimension of the operator connecting DM with the thermal bath and the associated scale of the UV physics. Thus we promote primordial GW to observables sensitive to feebly coupled inflaton, which is very challenging if not impossible to test in conventional particle physics laboratories or astrophysical measurements.\n",
      "22        We argue that demanding a consistent cosmological history, including the absence of domain walls and strongly interacting relics at the Peccei-Quinn scale, singles out two concrete realizations of hadronic QCD axions as viable <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> models. These realizations generally feature flavor-violating axion couplings to Standard Model quarks that are unsuppressed at low energies. As a consequence, experiments looking for flavor-violating hadronic processes involving the axion can be sensitive probes of QCD axion <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> models. In particular, we show that the NA62 and KOTO experiments could detect the $K\\rightarrowπ+ a$ decay for axions consistent with the observed <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> abundance via the post-inflationary misalignment mechanism.\n",
      "23        The mean <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> density within the turnaround radius, which is the boundary that separates a nonexpanding structure from the Hubble flow, was recently proposed as a novel cosmological probe. According to the spherical collapse model, the evolution with cosmic time of this turnaround density, $\\rm ρ_{ta}(z)$, can be used to determine both $\\rm Ω_m$ and $Ω_Λ$, independently of any other currently used probe. The properties of $\\rm ρ_{ta}$ predicted by the spherical collapse model were also shown to persist in the presence of full three-dimensional effects in $\\rm Λ$CDM N-body cosmological simulations when considering galaxy clusters at the present time, $z=0$. However, a small offset was discovered between the spherical-collapse prediction of the value of $ρ_{ta}$ at $z=0$ and its value measured in simulations. In this letter, we explore whether this offset evolves with cosmic time; whether it differs in different cosmologies; whether its origin can be confidently identified; and whether it can be corrected. We found that the offset does evolve slightly with redshift, and that it correlates strongly with the deviation from spherical symmetry of the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halo distribution inside and outside of the turnaround radius. We used an appropriate metric to quantify deviations in the environment of a structure from spherical symmetry. We found that using this metric, we can construct a sphericity-selected sample of halos for which the offset of $ρ_{ta}$ from the spherical collapse prediction is zero, independently of redshift and cosmology. We found that a sphericity-selected halo sample allows us to recover the simulated cosmology, and we conclude that the turnaround density evolution indeed encodes the cosmology in N-body simulations.\n",
      "24        We present a new suite of over 1,500 cosmological N-body simulations with varied Warm <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">Dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">Matter</span> (WDM) models ranging from 2.5 to 30 keV. We use these simulations to train Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to infer WDM particle masses from images of DM field data. Our fiducial setup can make accurate predictions of the WDM particle mass up to 7.5 keV at a 95% confidence level from small maps that cover an area of (25 h$^{-1}$ Mpc)$^2$. We vary the image resolution, simulation resolution, redshift, and cosmology of our fiducial setup to better understand how our model is making predictions. Using these variations, we find that our models are most dependent on simulation resolution, minimally dependent on image resolution, not systematically dependent on redshift, and robust to varied cosmologies. We also find that an important feature to distinguish between WDM models is present with a linear size between 100 and 200 h$^{-1}$ kpc. We compare our fiducial model to one trained on the power spectrum alone and find that our field-level model can make 2x more precise predictions and can make accurate predictions to 2x as massive WDM particle masses when used on the same data. Overall, we find that the field-level data can be used to accurately differentiate between WDM models and contain more information than is captured by the power spectrum. This technique can be extended to more complex DM models and opens up new opportunities to explore alternative DM models in a cosmological environment.\n",
      "25        The properties of globular clusters (GCs) contain valuable information of their host galaxies and <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span>-<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halos. In the remarkable example of ultra-diffuse galaxy, NGC5846-UDG1, the GC population exhibits strong radial mass segregation, indicative of dynamical-friction-driven orbital decay, which opens the possibility of using imaging data alone to constrain the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span>-<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> content of the galaxy. To explore this possibility, we develop a semi-analytical model of GC evolution, which starts from the initial mass function, the initial structure-mass relation, and the initial spatial distribution of the GC progenitors, and follows the effects of dynamical friction, tidal evolution, and two-body relaxation. Using Markov Chain Monte Carlo, we forward-model the GCs in a NGC5846-UDG1-like potential to match the observed GC mass, size, and spatial distributions, and to constrain the profile of the host halo and the origin of the GCs. We find that, with the assumptions of zero mass segregation when the star clusters were born, NGC5846-UDG1 is <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span>-<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> poor compared to what is expected from stellar-to-halo-mass relations, and its halo concentration is low, irrespective of having a cuspy or a cored halo profile. Its GC population has an initial spatial distribution more extended than the smooth stellar distribution. We discuss the results in the context of scaling laws of galaxy-halo connections, and warn against naively using the GC-abundance-halo-mass relation to infer the halo mass of UDGs. Our model is generally applicable to GC-rich dwarf galaxies, and is publicly available at https://github.com/JiangFangzhou/GCevo.\n",
      "26        The Epoch of Reionization (EoR) neutral Hydrogen (HI) 21-cm signal evolves significantly along the line-of-sight (LoS) due to the light-cone (LC) effect. It is important to accurately incorporate this in simulations in order to correctly interpret the signal. 21-cm LC simulations are typically produced by stitching together slices from a finite number $(N_{\\rm RS})$ of &#39;&#39;reionization snapshot&#39;&#39;, each corresponding to a different stage of reionization. In this paper, we have quantified the errors in the 21-cm LC simulation due to the finite value of $N_{\\rm RS}$. We show that this can introduce large discontinuities $(&gt; 200 \\%)$ at the stitching boundaries when $N_{\\rm RS}$ is small $(= 2,4)$ and the mean neutral fraction jumps by $δ\\bar{x}_{\\rm HI} = 0.2,0.1$ respectively at the stitching boundaries. This drops to $17 \\%$ for $N_{\\rm RS} = 13$ where $δ\\bar{x}_{\\rm HI}=0.02$. We present and also validate a method for mitigating this error by increasing $N_{\\rm RS}$ without a proportional increase in the computational costs which are mainly incurred in generating the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> and halo density fields. Our method generates these fields only at a few redshifts, and interpolates them to generate reionization snapshots at closely spaced redshifts. We use this to generate 21-cm LC simulations with $N_{\\rm RS} = 26,51,101$ and $201$, and show that the errors go down as $N_{\\rm RS}^{-1}$.\n",
      "27        The advent of gravitational wave astronomy has seen a huge influx of new predictions for potential discoveries of beyond the Standard Model fields. The coupling of all fundamental fields to gravity, together with its dominance on large scales, makes gravitational physics a rich laboratory to study fundamental physics. This holds especially true for the search for the elusive <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> photon, a promising <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> candidate. The <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> photon is predicted to generate instabilities in a rotating black hole spacetime, birthing a macroscopic Bose-Einstein condensate. These condensates can especially form around super massive black holes, modifying the dynamical inspiralling process. This then opens another window to leverage future space-borne gravitational wave antennas to join the hunt for the elusive <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> particle. This study builds a preliminary model for the gravitational waveform emitted by such a dressed extreme mass-ratio inspiral. Comparing these waveforms to the vacuum scenario allows projections to the potential constrainability on the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> photon mass by space-borne gravitational wave antennas. The superradiant instability of a massive vector field on a Kerr background is calculated and the modification to the dynamics of an inspiralling solar mass-scale compact object is determined with approximations on the backreaction effect of the cloud on the compact object. The end result is the projection that the LISA mission should be able to constrain the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> photon mass using extreme mass ratio inspirals in the range $[1.8 \\times 10^{-17}, 4.47 \\times 10^{-16}]$ eV.\n",
      "28        Recent observations made by the JWST have revealed a number of massive galaxies at high redshift ($z$). The presence of these galaxies appears at odds with the current $Λ$CDM cosmology. Here we investigate the possibility of alleviating the tension by incorporating uncertainties from three sources in counting massive galaxies at high $z$: cosmic variance, error in stellar mass estimate, and contribution by backsplash. We find that each of the sources can significantly increase the cumulative stellar mass density $ρ_*(&gt;M_*)$ at the high-mass end, and the combination of them can boost the density by more than one order of magnitude. Assuming a star formation efficiency of $ε_* \\sim 0.5$, cosmic variance alone can reduce the tension to $2σ$ level, except the most massive galaxy at $z=8$. Including in addition a lognormal dispersion with a width of 0.3 dex in the stellar mass can bring the observed stellar mass density at $z \\sim 7 - 10$ to the $2σ$ range of the cosmic variance. The tension is completely eliminated when gas stripped from backsplash halos is also taken into account. Our results highlight the importance of fully modeling uncertainties when interpreting observational data of rare objects. We use the constrained simulation, ELUCID, to investigate the descendants of high $z$ massive galaxies. We find that a significant portion of these galaxies end up in massive halos with mass $M_{\\rm halo} &gt; 10^{13} h^{-1}M_\\odot $ at $z=0$. A large fraction of central galaxies in $M_{\\rm halo} \\geqslant 10^{14.5} h^{-1}M_\\odot$ halos today are predicted to contain significant amounts of ancient stars formed in massive galaxies at $z\\sim 8$. This prediction can be tested by studying the structure and stellar population of central galaxies in present-day massive clusters.\n",
      "29        Within the $Λ$CDM cosmology, <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> haloes are comprised of both a smooth component and a population of smaller, gravitationally bound subhaloes. These components are often treated as a single halo when halo properties, such as density profiles, are extracted from simulations. Recent work has shown that density profiles change substantially when subhalo mass is excluded. In this paper, we expand on this result by analysing the change in three specific host halo properties -- concentration ($c_{\\rm{NFW}}$), spin ($λ_{\\rm Bullock}$), and shape ($c/a$), -- when calculated only from the smooth component of the halo. This analysis is performed on both Milky Way-mass haloes and cluster-mass haloes in high-resolution, zoom-in, $N$-body simulations. We find that when subhaloes are excluded the median value of (1) $c_{\\rm{NFW}}$ is enhanced by $\\approx 38 \\pm 12\\%$ and $\\approx 88 \\pm 7.7\\%$ for Milky Way mass ($10^{12.1}\\,\\text{M}_\\odot$) and cluster mass ($10^{14.8}\\,\\text{M}_\\odot$) haloes respectively, (2) $λ_{\\rm Bullock}$ is reduced for Milky Way mass by $\\approx 16 \\pm 6.8\\%$ and cluster mass haloes by $\\approx 32 \\pm 8.9\\%$. Additionally, with the removal of subhaloes, cluster mass haloes tend to become more spherical as the ratio of minor-to-major axis, $c/a$, increases by $\\approx 12 \\pm 4\\%$, whereas Milky Way mass haloes remain approximately the same shape with $c/a$ changed by $\\approx 1.2 \\pm 5.6\\%$. The fractional change of each of these properties depends primarily on the amount of mass that is removed from the halo system and, to a lesser extent, mass accretion history. Our findings demonstrate that the properties of the smooth components of <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> haloes are biased relative to the total mass of the halo including subhaloes.\n",
      "30        In order to test active galactic nucleus (AGN) unification and evolutionary models, we measured the AGN clustering properties as a function of AGN obscuration defined in terms of hydrogen column density, $N_{\\rm H}$. In addition to measuring the clustering of unobscured ($N_{\\rm H} &lt; 10^{22}\\,{\\rm cm}^{-2}$) and moderately obscured ($10^{22} \\leq N_{\\rm H} &lt; 10^{23.5}$) AGNs, we also targeted highly obscured sources ($N_{\\rm H}\\geq 10^{23.5}$) up to redshifts of $z=3$. We have compiled one of the largest samples of X-ray-selected AGNs from a total of eight deep XMM/Chandra surveys. We measured the clustering as a function of both AGN obscuration and redshift using the projected two-point correlation function, $w_{\\rm p}(r_{\\rm p})$. We modeled the large-scale clustering signal, measured the AGN bias, $b(z, N_{\\rm H})$, and interpreted it in terms of the typical AGN host <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halo, $M_{\\rm halo}(z, N_{\\rm H}$). We find no significant dependence of AGN clustering on obscuration, suggesting similar typical masses of the hosting halos as a function of $N_{\\rm H}$. This result matches expectations of AGN unification models, in which AGN obscuration depends mainly on the viewing angle of the obscuring torus. We measured, for the first time, the clustering of highly obscured AGNs and find that these objects reside in halos with typical mass $\\log M_{\\rm halo} = 12.98_{-0.22}^{+0.17} [h^{-1} M_\\odot]$ ($12.28_{-0.19}^{+0.13}$) at low $z \\sim 0.7$ (high $z \\sim 1.8$) redshifts. We find that irrespective of obscuration, an increase in AGN bias with redshift is slower than the expectation for a constant halo mass and instead follows the growth rate of halos, known as the passive evolution track. This implies that for those AGNs the clustering is mainly driven by the mass growth rate of the hosting halos and galaxies across cosmic time.\n",
      "31        Mergers between galaxy clusters are an important stage in the formation of the large-scale structure of the Universe. Some of the mergers show a spectacular bow shock that formed as a result of recent passage of a smaller cluster through a bigger one, the classic example of this being the so-called bullet cluster. In this paper, I describe ten examples of interacting clusters identified among 200 of the most massive objects, with total masses above $1.4 \\times 10^{14}$ M$_{\\odot}$, from the IllustrisTNG300 simulation by searching for prominent bow shocks in their temperature maps. Despite different mass ratios of the two merging clusters, the events are remarkably similar in many respects. In all cases, the companion cluster passed close to the main one only once, between 0.9 and 0.3 Gyr ago, with the pericenter distance of 100-530 kpc and a velocity of up to 3400 km s$^{-1}$. The subcluster, typically an order of magnitude smaller in mass than the main cluster before the interaction, loses most of its <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> and gas in the process. The displacement between the collisionless part of the remnant and the bow shock is such that the remnant typically lags behind the shock or coincides with it, with a single exception of the merger occurring with the largest velocity. Usually about 1% of the gas cells in the merging clusters are shocked, and the median Mach numbers of these gas cells are around two. Due to the relatively small size of the simulation box, no close analog of the bullet cluster was found, but I identified one case that is similar in terms of mass, velocity, and displacement. The presented cases bear more resemblance to less extreme observed interacting clusters such as A520 and Coma.\n",
      "32        Microscopic horizonless relics could form in the early universe either directly through gravitational collapse or as stable remnants of the Hawking evaporation of primordial black holes. In both cases they completely or partially evade cosmological constraints arising from Hawking evaporation and in certain mass ranges can explain the entirety of the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>. We systematically explore the stochastic gravitational-wave background associated with the formation of microscopic <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span>-<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> relics in various scenarios, adopting an agnostic approach and discussing the limitations introduced by existing constraints, possible ways to circumvent the latter, and expected astrophysical foregrounds. Interestingly, this signal is at most marginally detectable with current interferometers but could be detectable by third-generations instruments such as the Einstein Telescope, strengthening their potential as discovery machines.\n",
      "33        In direct <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> (DM) detection via scattering off the electrons, the momentum transfer plays a crucial role. Previous work showed that for self-interacting DM, if the DM particle has a size (the so-called puffy DM), the radius effect could dominate the momentum transfer and become another source of velocity dependence for self-scattering cross section. In this work we investigate the direct detection of puffy DM particles with different radii through electron recoil. We find that comparing with the available experimental exclusion limits dominated by the mediator effect for XENON10, XENON100 and XENON1T, the constraints on the puffy DM-electron scattering cross-section become much weaker for large radius DM particles. For small-radius DM particles, the constraints remain similar to the point-like DM case.\n",
      "34        Boson stars are gravitationally bound objects that arise in ultralight <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> models and form in the centers of galactic halos or axion miniclusters. We systematically study the excitations of a boson star, taking into account the mixing between positive and negative frequencies introduced by gravity. We show that the spectrum contains zero-energy modes in the monopole and dipole sectors resulting from spontaneous symmetry breaking by the boson star background. We analyze the general properties of the eigenmodes and derive their orthogonality and completeness conditions which have non-standard form due to the positive-negative frequency mixing. The eigenvalue problem is solved numerically for the first few energy levels in different multipole sectors and the results are compared to the solutions of the Schrödinger equation in fixed boson star gravitational potential. The two solutions differ significantly for the lowest modes, but get close for higher levels. We further confirm the normal mode spectrum in 3D wave simulations where we inject perturbations with different multipoles. As an application of the normal mode solutions, we compute the matrix element entering the evaporation rate of a boson star immersed in a hot axion gas. The computation combines the use of exact wavefunctions for the low-lying bound states and of the Schrödinger approximation for the high-energy excitations.\n",
      "35        If long-range attractive forces exist and are stronger than gravity then cosmic halo formation can begin in the radiation-dominated era. We study a simple realization of this effect in a system where <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> fermions have Yukawa interactions mediated by scalar particles, analogous to the Higgs boson in the standard model. We develop a self-consistent description of the system including exact background dynamics of the scalar field, and precise modelling of the fermion density fluctuations. For the latter, we provide accurate approximations for the linear growth as well as quantitative modelling of the nonlinear evolution using N-body simulations. We find that halo formation occurs exponentially fast and on scales substantially larger than simple estimates predict. The final fate of these halos remains uncertain, but could be annihilation, <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> stars, primordial black holes, or even the existence of galaxy-sized halos at <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>-radiation equality. More generally, our results demonstrate the importance of mapping scalar-mediated interactions onto structure formation outcomes and constraints for beyond the standard model theories.\n",
      "36        Recent analysis on the stellar kinematics of ultra-faint dwarf (UFD) galaxies has put a stringent upper limit on the self-scattering cross section of <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>, i.e., $σ/m&lt;{\\cal O}(0.1)\\,{\\rm cm^2/g}$ at the scattering velocity of ${\\cal O}(10)\\,{\\rm km/s}$. Resonant self-interacting <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> (rSIDM) is one possibility that can be consistent with the UFDs and explain the low central densities of rotation-supported galaxies; the cross section is resonantly enhanced to be $σ/m = {\\cal O}(1)\\,{\\rm cm^2/g}$ around the scattering velocity of ${\\cal O}(100)\\,{\\rm km/s}$ while being suppressed at lower velocities. To further assess this possibility, since the inferred <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> distribution of halos from astrophysical observations is usually compared to that in constant-cross section SIDM (cSIDM), whether the structures of rSIDM halos can be approximated by the cSIDM halo profiles needs to be clarified. In this work, we employ the grovothermal fluid method to investigate the structural evolution of rSIDM halos in a wide mass range. We find that except for halos in a specific mass range, the present structures of rSIDM halos are virtually indistinguishable from those of the cSIDM halos. For halos in the specific mass range, the resonant self-scattering renders a break in their density profile. We demonstrate how such a density-profile break appears in astrophysical observations, e.g., rotation curves and line-of-sight velocity dispersion profiles. We show that for halos above the specific mass range, the density-profile break thermalizes to disappear before the present. We demonstrate that such distinctive thermalization dynamics can leave imprints on the orbital classes of stars with similar ages and metallicities.\n",
      "37        The E-type $α$-attractor models of single-field inflation were generalized further in order to accommodate production of primordial black holes (PBH) via adding a near-inflection point to the inflaton scalar potential at smaller scales, in good agreement with measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation. A minimal number of new parameters was used but their fine-tuning was maximized in order to increase possible masses of PBH formed during an ultra-slow-roll phase leading to a large enhancement of the power spectrum of scalar (curvature) perturbations by 6 or 7 orders of magnitude against the power spectrum of perturbations observed in CMB. It was found that extreme fine-tuning of the parameters in our models can lead to a formation of the Earth-size PBH with the masses of approximately $10^{27}$ g, still in agreement with CMB observations. Quantum corrections are known to lead to the perturbative upper bound on the amplitude of large scalar perturbations responsible for PBH production. The quantum (one-loop) corrections in our models were found to be suppressed by one order of magnitude for PBH with the masses of approximately $10^{19}$ g, which may form the whole <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> in the Universe.\n",
      "38        We discuss in detail the possibility that the &#34;type-II majoron&#34; -- that is, the pseudo Nambu-Goldstone boson that arises in the context of the type-II seesaw mechanism if the lepton number is spontaneously broken by an additional singlet scalar -- account for the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> (DM) observed in the universe. We study the requirements the model&#39;s parameters have to fulfill in order to reproduce the measured DM relic abundance through two possible production mechanisms in the early universe, freeze-in and misalignment, both during a standard radiation-dominated era and early <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> domination. We then study possible signals of type-II majoron DM and the present and expected constraints on the parameter space that can be obtained from cosmological observations, direct detection experiments, and present and future searches for decaying DM at neutrino telescopes and cosmic-ray experiments. We find that -- depending on the majoron mass, the production mechanism, and the value of the vacuum expectation value of the type-II triplet -- all of the three decay modes (photons, electrons, neutrinos) of majoron DM particles can yield observable signals at future indirect searches for DM. Furthermore, in a corner of the parameter space, detection of majoron DM is possible through electron recoil at running and future direct detection experiments.\n",
      "39        Running vacuum models and viscous <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> scenarios beyond perfect fluid idealization are two appealing theoretical strategies that have been separately studied as alternatives to solve some problems rooted in the $Λ$CDM cosmological model. In this paper, we combine these two notions in a single cosmological setting and investigate their cosmological implications, paying particular attention in the interplay between these two constituents in different cosmological periods. Specifically, we consider a well-studied running vacuum model inspired by renormalization group, and a recently proposed general parameterization for the bulk viscosity $ξ$. By employing dynamical system analysis, we explore the physical aspects of the new phase space that emerges from the combined models and derive stability conditions that ensure complete cosmological dynamics. We identify four distinct classes of models and find that the critical points of the phase space are non-trivially renewed compared to the single scenarios. We then proceed, in a joint and complementary way to the dynamical system analysis, with a detailed numerical exploration to quantify the impact of both the running parameter and the bulk viscosity coefficient on the cosmological evolution. Thus, for some values of the model parameters, numerical solutions show qualitative differences from the $Λ$CDM model, which is phenomenologically appealing in light of cosmological observations.\n",
      "40        The intrinsic alignment (IA) of observed galaxy shapes with the underlying cosmic web is a source of contamination in weak lensing surveys. Sensitive methods to identify the IA signal will therefore need to be included in the upcoming weak lensing analysis pipelines. Hydrodynamical cosmological simulations allow us to directly measure the intrinsic ellipticities of galaxies and thus provide a powerful approach to predict and understand the IA signal. Here we employ the novel, large-volume hydrodynamical simulation MTNG740, a product of the MillenniumTNG (MTNG) project, to study the IA of galaxies. We measure the projected correlation functions between the intrinsic shape/shear of galaxies and various tracers of large-scale structure, $w_{+g},\\ w_{+m},\\ w_{++}$ over the radial range $r_{\\rm p} \\in [0.02 , 200]\\,h^{-1}{\\rm Mpc}$ and at redshifts $z=0.0$, $0.5$ and $1.0$. We detect significant signal-to-noise IA signals with the density field for both elliptical and spiral galaxies. We also find significant intrinsic shear-shear correlations for ellipticals. We further examine correlations of the intrinsic shape of galaxies with the local tidal field. Here we find a significant IA signal for elliptical galaxies assuming a linear model. We also detect a weak IA signal for spiral galaxies under a quadratic tidal torquing model. Lastly, we measure the alignment between central galaxies and their host <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span>-<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halos, finding small to moderate misalignments between their principal axes that decline with halo mass.\n",
      "41        We study weak gravitational lensing convergence maps produced from the MillenniumTNG (MTNG) simulations by direct projection of the mass distribution on the past backwards lightcone of a fiducial observer. We explore the lensing maps over a large dynamic range in simulation mass and angular resolution, allowing us to establish a clear assessment of numerical convergence. By comparing full physics hydrodynamical simulations with corresponding <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span>-<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>-only runs we quantify the impact of baryonic physics on the most important weak lensing statistics. Likewise, we predict the impact of massive neutrinos reliably far into the non-linear regime. We also demonstrate that the &#34;fixed &amp; paired&#34; variance suppression technique increases the statistical robustness of the simulation predictions on large scales not only for time slices but also for continuously output lightcone data. We find that both baryonic and neutrino effects substantially impact weak lensing shear measurements, with the latter dominating over the former on large angular scales. Thus, both effects must explicitly be included to obtain sufficiently accurate predictions for stage IV lensing surveys. Reassuringly, our results agree accurately with other simulation results where available, supporting the promise of simulation modelling for precision cosmology far into the non-linear regime.\n",
      "42        An era of kination occurs when the Universe&#39;s energy density is dominated by a fast-rolling scalar field. <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">Dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> that is thermally produced during an era of kination requires larger-than-canonical annihilation cross sections to generate the observed <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> relic abundance. Furthermore, <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> density perturbations that enter the horizon during an era of kination grow linearly with the scale factor prior to radiation domination. We show how the resulting enhancement to the small-scale <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> power spectrum increases the microhalo abundance and boosts the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> annihilation rate. We then use gamma-ray observations to constrain thermal <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> production during kination. The annihilation boost factor depends on the minimum halo mass, which is determined by the small-scale cutoff in the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> power spectrum. Therefore, observational limits on the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> annihilation rate imply a minimum cutoff scale for a given <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> particle mass and kination scenario. For <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> that was once in thermal equilibrium with the Standard Model, this constraint establishes a maximum allowed kinetic decoupling temperature for the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>. This bound on the decoupling temperature implies that the growth of perturbations during kination cannot appreciably boost the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> annihilation rate if <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> was once in thermal equilibrium with the Standard Model.\n",
      "43        We present the measurement of total and stellar/<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> decomposed mass density profile around a sample of galaxy groups and clusters with dynamical masses derived from integral-field stellar kinematics from the MaNGA survey in Paper~I and weak lensing derived from the DECaLS imaging survey. Combining the two data sets enables accurate measurement of the radial density distribution from several kpc to Mpc scales. Intriguingly, we find that the excess surface density derived from stellar kinematics in the inner region cannot be explained by simply adding an NFW <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halo extrapolated from lensing measurement at a larger scale to a stellar mass component derived from the NASA-Sloan Atlas (NSA) catalog. We find that a good fit to both data sets requires a stellar mass normalization about 3 times higher than that derived from the NSA catalog, which would require an unrealistically too-heavy initial mass function for stellar mass estimation. If we keep the stellar mass normalization to that of the NSA catalog but allow a varying inner <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> density profile, we obtain an asymptotic slope of $γ_{\\rm gnfw}$= $1.82_{-0.25}^{+0.15}$, $γ_{\\rm gnfw}$= $1.48_{-0.41}^{+0.20}$ for the group bin and the cluster bin respectively, significantly steeper than the NFW case. We also compare the total mass inner density slopes with those from Illustris-TNG300 and find that the values from the simulation are lower than the observation by at least $3σ$ level.\n",
      "44        We present dynamical scaling relations, combined with the stellar population properties, for a subsample of about 6000 nearby galaxies with the most reliable dynamical models extracted from the full MaNGA sample of 10K galaxies. We show that the inclination-corrected mass plane (MP) for both early-type galaxies (ETGs) and late-type galaxies (LTGs), which links dynamical mass, projected half-light radius $R_{\\rm e}$, and the second stellar velocity moment $σ_{\\rm e}$ within $R_{\\rm e}$, satisfies the virial theorem and is even tighter than the uncorrected one. We find a clear parabolic relation between $\\lg(M/L)(&lt;R_{\\rm e})$, the total mass-to-light ratio within a sphere of radius $R_{\\rm e}$, and $\\lgσ_{\\rm e}$, with the $M/L$ increasing with $σ_{\\rm e}$ and for older stellar populations. However, the relation for ETGs is linear and the one for the youngest galaxies is constant. We confirm and improve the relation between average logarithmic total density slopes $γ_{_{\\rm T}}$ and $σ_{\\rm e}$: $γ_{_{\\rm T}}$ become steeper with increasing $σ_{\\rm e}$ until $\\lg(σ_{\\rm e}/{\\rm km\\,s^{-1}})\\approx 2.2$ and then remain constant around $γ_{_{\\rm T}}\\approx -2.2$. The $γ_{_{\\rm T}}-σ_{\\rm e}$ variation is larger for LTGs than ETGs. At fixed $σ_{\\rm e}$ the total density profiles steepen with galaxy age and for ETGs. We find generally low <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> fractions, median $f_{\\rm DM}(&lt;R_{\\rm e})=8$ per cent, within a sphere of radius $R_{\\rm e}$.

The increased $f_{\\rm DM}(&lt;R_{\\rm e})$ at low $σ_{\\rm e}$ explains the parabolic $\\lg(M/L)(&lt;R_{\\rm e})-\\lgσ_{\\rm e}$ relation.\n",
      "45        We analyze the global stellar population, radial gradients and non-parametric star formation history of $\\sim 10$K galaxies from the MaNGA Survey final data release 17 (DR17), based on stellar population synthesis and full-spectrum fitting, and relate them with dynamical properties of galaxies. We confirm that stellar population correlates with stellar velocity dispersion $σ_{\\rm e}$ better than with stellar mass $M_{\\ast}$, but also find that younger galaxies are more metal-poor at fixed $σ_{\\rm e}$. Stellar age, metallicity, and mass-to-light ratio $M_{\\ast}/L$ all decrease with galaxy rotation, while radial gradients become more negative (i.e., younger, more metal-poor, and lower $M_{\\ast}/L$ in the outskirts). The trend between metallicity gradients and rotation reverses for slow rotators, which stand out for their more negative metallicity gradients than faster-rotating galaxies. We highlight a population of massive disk galaxies on the green valley, on the $(σ_{\\rm e},\\rm Age)$ plane, that show steep negative age and metallicity gradients, consistent with their old central bulges surrounded by young star-forming disks and metal-poor gas accretion. Galaxies with high $σ_{\\rm e}$, steep total mass-density slope, low <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> fraction, high $M_{\\ast}/L$, and high metallicity have the highest star-formation rate at earlier times, and are currently quenched.

      "46        This is the first paper in our series on the combined analysis of the Dynamics and stellar Population (DynPop) for the MaNGA survey in the final SDSS Data Release 17 (DR17). Here we present a catalogue of dynamically-determined quantities for over 10000 nearby galaxies based on integral-field stellar kinematics from the MaNGA survey. The dynamical properties are extracted using the axisymmetric Jeans Anisotropic Modelling (JAM) method, which was previously shown to be the most accurate for this kind of study. We assess systematic uncertainties using eight dynamical models with different assumptions. We use two orientations of the velocity ellipsoid: either cylindrically-aligned JAM$_{\\rm cyl}$ or spherically-aligned JAM$_{\\rm sph}$. We also make four assumptions for the models&#39; <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> vs. luminous <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> distributions: (1) mass-follows-light, (2) free NFW <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> halo, (3) cosmologically-constrained NFW halo, (4) generalized NFW <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> halo, i.e. with free inner slope. In this catalogue, we provide the quantities related to the mass distributions (e.g. the density slopes and enclosed mass within a sphere of a given radius for total mass, stellar mass, and <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> mass components). We also provide the complete models which can be used to compute the full luminous and mass distribution of each galaxy. Additionally, we visually assess the qualities of the models to help with model selections. We estimate the observed scatter in the measured quantities which decreases as expected with improvements in quality. For the best data quality, we find a remarkable consistency of measured quantities between different models, highlighting the robustness of the results.\n",
      "47        What is the highest energy at which gravitons can be observed? We address this question by studying graviton-to-photon conversion - the inverse-Gertsenshtein effect - in the magnetic field of the Milky Way. We find that above $\\sim 1~\\mbox{PeV}$ the effective photon mass grows large enough to quench the conversion rate. The induced photon flux is comparable to the sensitivity of LHAASO to a diffuse $γ$-ray background, but only for graviton abundances of order $Ω_{\\text{gw}} h^2_0 \\sim 1$. In the future, owing to a better understanding of $γ$-ray backgrounds, larger effective areas and longer observation times, sub-PeV shimmering gravitons with a realistic abundance of $Ω_{\\text{gw}} h^2_0 \\sim 0.01$ could be detected. We show that this is achieved in a cosmologically-motivated scenario of post-recombination superheavy <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> decay. Therefore, the sub-PeV range might be the ultimate energy frontier at which gravitons can be observed.\n",
      "48        The relation between the total mass contained in the globular clusters of a galaxy and the mass of its <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halo has been found observationally to be nearly linear over five decades of mass. However, the high-mass end of this relation is not well determined from previous data and shows large scatter. We analyze the globular cluster systems (GCSs) of a homogeneous sample of 11 brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) through DOLPHOT photometry of their deep Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images in the F814W filter. We standardize the definition of $M_{GCS}$, the total GCS mass, by using the GC total population within a limiting radius of $0.1 R_{virial}$, while the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span>-<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halo mass $M_h$ is determined from the weak-lensing calibration of $M_h$ versus $M_{bary}$. When these 11 BCGs are added to the previously studied homogeneous catalogue of Virgo member galaxies, a total value for $η= M_{GCS}/M_h$ is found to be $(3.0\\pm1.8_{internal})\\times10^{-5}$, slightly higher than previous estimates but with much reduced uncertainty. Perhaps more importantly, the results suggest that the relation continues to have a near-linear shape at the highest galaxy masses, strongly reinforcing the conclusion that accreted GCs make a major contribution to the GC populations at high galaxy mass.\n",
      "49        We introduce an analytic surface density profile for <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halos that accurately reproduces the structure of simulated halos of mass $M_{\\rm vir} = 10^{7-11}\\ M_\\odot$, making it useful for modeling line-of-sight perturbers in strong gravitational lensing models. The two-parameter function has an analytic deflection potential and is more accurate than the projected Navarro, Frenk &amp; White (NFW) profile commonly adopted at this mass scale for perturbers, especially at the small radii of most relevant for lensing perturbations. Using a characteristic radius, $R_{-1}$, where the log slope of surface density is equal to $-1$, and an associated surface density, $Σ_{-1}$, we can represent the expected lensing signal from line-of-sight halos statistically, for an ensemble of halo orientations, using a distribution of {\\em projected concentration} parameters, $\\mathcal{C}_{\\rm vir} := r_{\\rm vir}/ R_{-1}$. Though an individual halo can have a projected concentration that varies with orientation with respect to the observer, the range of projected concentrations correlates with the usual three-dimensional halo concentration in a way that enables ease of use.\n",
      "50        Axions and axion-like particles (ALPs) are a prominent <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> candidate, drawing motivation in part from the axiverse of string theory. Axion-like particles can also arise as composite degrees of freedom of a <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> sector, for example, as <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> pions in <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> Quantum Chromo-Dynamics. In a <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> Standard Model (SM) wherein all 6 quark flavors are light while the photon is massive, one finds a rich low-energy spectrum of stable and ultralight particles, in the form of neutral and charged <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> scalars, and complex neutral scalars analogous to the SM kaon, with mass splittings determined by the mass and charge of the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> quarks. The model finds a natural portal to the visible sector via kinetic coupling of the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> and visible photons, and consequent millicharges for <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>. The <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> can be a mixture of all these ultralight bosonic degrees of freedom, and exhibit both parity-even and parity-odd interactions, making the theory testable at a wide variety of experiments. In context of <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> QCD with $N_f$ flavors of light quarks, this scenario predicts $N_f^2-1$ ultralight axion-like particles -- effectively an axiverse from <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> QCD.

      "51        The most luminous quasars at $z &gt; 6$ are suspected to be both highly clustered and reside in the most massive <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halos in the early Universe, making them prime targets to search for galaxy overdensities and/or protoclusters. We search for Lyman-break dropout-selected galaxies using HST WFC3/ACS broadband imaging in the fields of three $6 &lt; z &lt; 7$ quasars, as well as their simultaneously observed coordinated-parallel fields, and constrain their photometric redshifts using EAZY. One field, J0305-3150, shows a volume density 10$\\times$ higher than the blank-field UV luminosity function (UVLF) at M$_{UV} &lt; -20$, with tentative evidence of a 3$σ$ overdensity in its parallel field located 15 cMpc away. Another field, J2054-0005, shows an angular overdensity within 500 ckpc from the quasar but still consistent with UVLF predictions within 3$σ$, while the last field, J2348-3054, shows no enhancement. We discuss methods for reducing uncertainty in overdensity measurements when using photometric selection and show that we can robustly select LBGs consistent with being physically associated with the quasar, corroborated by existing JWST/NIRCam WFSS data in the J0305 field. Even accounting for incompleteness, the overdensities in J0305 and J2054 are higher for brighter galaxies at short angular separations, suggesting preferential enhancement of more massive galaxies in the immediate vicinity of the quasar. Finally, we compare the LBG population with previously-identified [CII] and mm-continuum companions; the LBG overdensities are not accompanied by an enhanced number of dusty galaxies, suggesting that the overdense quasar fields are not in the bursty star-forming phase sometimes seen in high-redshift protoclusters.\n"

      "2        This thesis explores the effects of <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> (DM) on neutron stars (NSs) using the relativistic mean-field (RMF) model. The effects of DM on NS properties, including the mass-radius relation, the moment of inertia, and tidal deformability, are calculated by varying its fraction. The study found that the EOS becomes softer with increasing DM momentum, and the DM has marginal effects on nuclear <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> properties, except for the EOSs and binding energy per particle. The study also calculated the properties of isolated, static, and rotating DM admixed NS and found that the DM has significant effects on both static and rotating NS. We have also observed that a tiny amount of DM can accumulate inside the NS, and more amount of it makes the NS unstable. The study also suggests that the secondary component might be a NS with DM content if the underlying nuclear EOS is sufficiently stiff. The $f$-mode oscillations of the DM admixed hyperon stars are calculated and found that there exist a correlation between canonical $f$-mode frequency and the dimensionless tidal deformability parameter ($Λ_{1.4}$) and we have put a constraint on $f$-mode frequency using GW170817 data. Finally, we have calculated the DM admixed binary NS properties and found that the binary system becomes less deformed and sustains more time in its inspiral phases with the addition of DM. Therefore, we suggest that one can take DM inside the compact objects while modeling the inspiral waveforms for the BNS systems.\n",
      "3        Radiative emissions from electrons and positrons generated by <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> (DM) annihilation or decay are one of the most investigated signals in indirect searches of WIMPs. Ideal targets must have large ratio of DM to baryonic <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>. However, such ``<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span>&#39;&#39; systems have a poorly known level of magnetic turbulence, which determines the residence time of the electrons and positrons and therefore also the strength of the expected signal. This typically leads to significant uncertainties in the derived DM bounds. In a novel approach, we compute the self-confinement of the DM-induced electrons and positrons. Indeed, they themselves generate irregularities in the magnetic field, thus setting a lower limit on the presence of the magnetic turbulence. We specifically apply this approach to dwarf spheroidal galaxies. Finally, by comparing the expected synchrotron emission with radio data from the direction of the Draco galaxy collected at the Giant Metre Radio Telescope, we show that the proposed approach can be used to set robust and competitive bounds on WIMP DM.\n",
      "4        The particle origin of <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> (DM) is still one of the main puzzles in modern physics. One of the most promising search strategy to detect DM at laboratories is through the indirect search of cosmic particles that are produced from DM annihilation in space. In particular, the flux of cosmic positrons has been measured with high precision by the AMS-02 experiment demonstrating that an excess above 10 GeV, with respect to the secondary production, is present. We study in this paper the possible DM origin of the positron excess finding the values of the DM mass $M$ and annihilation cross section $\\langle σv \\rangle$ that are needed to fit high-energy positron data. In particular, we find that for DM annihilating into $b\\bar{b}$ it is required to have $M=43$ TeV and $\\langle σv \\rangle = 10^{-21}$ cm$^3$/s while for $τ^+τ^-$ $M=2$ TeV and $\\langle σv \\rangle = 3\\times 10^{-23}$ cm$^3$/s. If DM produce positrons, they are expected to generate gamma rays from the center of the Milky Way and around dwarf galaxy satellites of the Galaxy. We thus combine the values for the DM mass and annihilation cross section obtained with the fit to AMS-02 positron data with the upper limits derived with the non-detection of $γ$ rays with HESS in the direction of the Galactic center and Fermi-LAT for the combined analysis of dwarf galaxies. The main result of the paper is that only DM annihilating into $μ^+ μ^-$ with a mass around 500 GeV and $\\langle σv \\rangle = 4\\times 10^{-24}$ cm$^3$/s can fit AMS-02 data and be compatible with the upper limits found with $γ$ rays. As for the $τ^+ τ^-$ ($b\\bar{b}$) channel, DM can contribute at most at a few tens $\\%$ (a few \\%) level.\n",

We study a semi-analytical subhalo model for interacting <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> with radiation, based on the extended Press-Schechter formalism and subhalos&#39; tidal evolution prescription. We also test the elastic scattering between DM and neutrinos using observations of Milky-Way satellites from the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">Dark</span> Energy Survey and PanSTARRS1. We conservatively impose strong constraints on the DM-neutrino scattering cross section of $σ_{{\\rm DM}\\text{-}ν,n}\\propto E_ν^n$ $(n=0,2,4)$ at $95\\%$ confidence level (CL), $σ_{{\\rm DM}\\text{-}ν,0}&lt; 10^{-32}\\ {\\rm cm^2}\\ (m_{\\rm DM}/{\\rm GeV})$, $σ_{{\\rm DM}\\text{-}ν,2}&lt; 10^{-43}\\ {\\rm cm^2}\\ (m_{\\rm DM}/{\\rm GeV})(E_ν/E_ν^0)^2$ and $σ_{{\\rm DM}\\text{-}ν,4}&lt; 10^{-54}\\ {\\rm cm^2}\\ (m_{\\rm DM}/{\\rm GeV})(E_ν/E_ν^0)^4$, where $E_ν^0$ is the average momentum of relic cosmic neutrinos today, $E_ν^0 \\simeq 3.15 T_ν^0 \\simeq 6.1\\ {\\rm K}$.

      "6        Numerous observations suggest that there exist undiscovered beyond-the-Standard-Model particles and fields. Because of their unknown nature, these exotic particles and fields could interact with Standard Model particles in many different ways and assume a variety of possible configurations. Here we present an overview of the Global Network of Optical Magnetometers for Exotic physics searches (GNOME), our ongoing experimental program designed to test a wide range of exotic physics scenarios. The GNOME experiment utilizes a worldwide network of shielded atomic magnetometers (and, more recently, comagnetometers) to search for spatially and temporally correlated signals due to torques on atomic spins from exotic fields of astrophysical origin. We survey the temporal characteristics of a variety of possible signals currently under investigation such as those from topological defect <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> (axion-like particle domain walls), axion-like particle stars, solitons of complex-valued scalar fields (Q-balls), stochastic fluctuations of bosonic <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> fields, a solar axion-like particle halo, and bursts of ultralight bosonic fields produced by cataclysmic astrophysical events such as binary black hole mergers.\n",
      "7        Recent observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) are yielding tantalizing hints of an early population of massive, bright galaxies at $z &gt; 10$, with Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) observations indicating significant dust masses in place as early as $z\\sim 7$. To understand the implications of these observations, we use the DELPHI semi-analytic model that jointly tracks the assembly of <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halos and their constituent baryons, including the key processes of dust enrichment. Our model employs only two redshift- and mass-independent free parameters that are tuned against all available galaxy data at $z \\sim 5-9$ before it is used to make predictions up to $z \\sim 20$. Our key results are: (1) the model progressively under-predicts the observed ultraviolet luminosity function (UV LF) at $z &gt; 12$; observations at $z&gt;16$ lie close to, or even above, a &#34;maximal&#34; model where all available gas is turned into stars; (2) UV selection would miss 34% of the star formation rate density at $z \\sim 5$, decreasing to 17% by $z \\sim 10$ for bright galaxies with $\\rm{M_{UV}} &lt; -19$; (3) the dust mass ($M_d$) evolves with the stellar mass ($M_*$) and redshift as $\\log(M_d) = 1.194\\log(M_*) + 0.0975z - 5.433$; (4) the escape fraction of UV photons ($f_{\\rm esc}^{\\rm UV}$) decreases with increasing mass and star formation rate. At $z \\sim 7$, $f_{\\rm esc}^{\\rm UV} \\sim 0.8~(0.1)$ for $M_* \\sim 10^9~ (10^{11}) \\, M_\\odot$ galaxies; (5) the dust temperature increases with stellar mass, ranging between $30-33$ K for $M_* \\sim 10^{9-11}M_\\odot$ galaxies at $z \\sim 7$. Finally, we predict the far infrared (FIR) LF at $z \\sim 5-20$, testable with ALMA observations, and caution that spectroscopic redshifts and dust masses must be pinned down before invoking unphysical extrema in galaxy formation models.\n",
      "8        We reexamine the consequences of perturbative unitarity on <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> freeze-out when both Sommerfeld enhancement and bound state formation affect <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> annihilations. At leading order (LO) the annihilation cross-section is infrared dominated and the connection between the unitarity bound and the upper bound on the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> mass depends only on how the different partial waves are populated. We compute how this picture is modified at next-to-leading order (NLO) with the goal of assigning a reliable theory uncertainty to the freeze-out predictions. We explicitly compute NLO corrections in a simple model with abelian gauge interactions and provide an estimate of the theoretical uncertainty for the thermal masses of heavy electroweak $n$-plets. Along the way, we clarify the regularization and matching procedure necessary to deal with singular potentials in quantum mechanics with a calculable relativistic UV completion.\n",
      "9        We provide an algorithm for evolving general spin-$s$ Gross-Pitaevskii / non-linear Schrödinger systems carrying a variety of interactions, where the $2s+1$ components of the `spinor&#39; field represent the different spin-multiplicity states. We consider many nonrelativistic interactions up to quartic order in the Schrödinger field (both short and long-range, and spin-dependent and spin-independent interactions), including explicit spin-orbit couplings. The algorithm allows for spatially varying external and/or self-generated vector potentials that couple to the spin density of the field. Our work can be used for scenarios ranging from laboratory systems such as spinor Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs), to cosmological/astrophysical systems such as self-interacting bosonic <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>. As examples, we provide results for two different setups of spin-$1$ BECs that employ a varying magnetic field and spin-orbit coupling, respectively, and also collisions of spin-$1$ solitons in <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>.

      "10        We discuss the production of primordial black holes in an early <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> dominated era, which typically takes place in string inspired early universe cosmological models. In particular, we consider a pre-big bang scenario (extending previous results regarding formation in the radiation dominated era) where the enhancement of curvature perturbations is induced by a variation of the sound-speed parameter c_s during the string phase of high-curvature inflation. After imposing all relevant observational constraints, we find that the considered class of models is compatible with the production of a large amount of primordial black holes, in the mass range relevant to <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>, only for a small range of the parameters space.

An indication for a non-zero coupling between <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> and neutrinos (both assuming a temperature independent and $T^2$ dependent cross-section) is obtained at the 1$σ$ level coming from the ACT CMB data alone and when combined with the Planck CMB and Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) measurements. This result is confirmed by both fixing the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom in the early Universe to the Standard Model value of $N_{\\rm eff}=3.044$, and allowing $N_{\\rm eff}$ to be a free cosmological parameter. Furthermore, when performing a Bayesian model comparison, the interacting $ν$DM (+$N_{\\rm eff}$) scenario is mostly preferred over a baseline $Λ$CDM (+$N_{\\rm eff}$) cosmology. The preferred value is then used as a benchmark and the potential implications of <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter&#39;s</span> interaction with a sterile neutrino are discussed.\n",

The $\\ell$-boson stars are numerical solutions to the non-relativistic limit of the Einstein-Klein-Gordon system, the Schrödinger-Poisson (SP) system. These solutions are parametrized by an angular momentum number $\\ell = (N-1)/2$ and an excitation number $n$. We perform a bayesian analysis by modifying the SimpleMC code to perform the parameter inference, for the cases with $\\ell = 0$, $\\ell = 1$ and multistates of $\\ell$-boson stars. We used the Akaike information criterion (AIC), Bayesian information criterion and the Bayes factor to compare the excited state ($\\ell$=1) and the multistate case with the ground state ($\\ell$=0) as the base model due to its simplicity. We found that the data in most galaxies in the sample favours the multistates case and that the scalar field mass tends to be slightly bigger than the ground state case.\n",
      "15        A long-standing observed curiosity of globular clusters (GCs) has been that both the number and total mass of GCs in a galaxy are linearly correlated with the galaxy&#39;s virial mass, whereas its stellar component shows no such linear correlation. This work expands on an empirical model for the numbers and ages of GCs in galaxies presented by Valenzuela et al. (2021) that is consistent with recent observational data from massive elliptical galaxies down to the dwarf galaxy regime. Applying the model to simulations, GC numbers are shown to be excellent tracers for the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> (DM) virial mass, even when distinct formation mechanisms are employed for blue and red GCs. Furthermore, the amount of DM smooth accretion is encoded in the GC abundances, therefore providing a measure for an otherwise nearly untraceable component of the formation history of galaxies.\n",
      "16        We analytically solve the problem of Bose star growth in the bath of gravitationally interacting particles. We find that after nucleation of this object, the bath is described by a self-similar solution of the kinetic equation, which is an attractor. Together with the conservation laws, this fixes mass evolution of the Bose star. Our results explain slowdown of the star growth at a certain &#34;core-halo&#34; mass, but also predict formation of the heavier and lighter objects in magistral <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> models.\n",
      "17        <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">Dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> subhaloes are key for the predictions of simulations of structure formation, but their existence frequently ends prematurely due to two technical issues, namely numerical disruption in N-body simulations and halo finders failing to identify them. Here we focus on the second issue, using the phase-space friends-of-friends halo finder ROCKSTAR as a benchmark (though we expect our results to translate to comparable codes). We confirm that the most prominent cause for losing track of subhaloes is tidal distortion rather than a low number of particles. As a solution, we present a flexible post-processing algorithm that tracks all subhalo particles over time, computes subhalo positions and masses based on those particles, and progressively removes stripped <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>. If a subhalo is lost by the halo finder, this algorithm keeps tracking its so-called ghost until it has almost no particles left or has truly merged with its host. We apply this technique to a large suite of N-body simulations and restore lost subhaloes to the halo catalogues, which has a dramatic effect on key summary statistics of large-scale structure. Specifically, the subhalo mass function increases by about 50% and the halo correlation function increases by a factor of two at small scales. While these quantitative results are somewhat specific to our algorithm, they demonstrate that particle tracking is a promising way to reliably follow haloes and reduce the need for orphan models. Our algorithm and augmented halo catalogues are publicly available.\n",
      "18        Ultralight bosons are predicted in many extensions to the Standard Model and are popular <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> candidates. The black hole superradiance mechanism allows for these particles to be probed using only their gravitational interaction. In this scenario, an ultralight boson cloud may form spontaneously around a spinning black hole and extract a non-negligible fraction of the black hole&#39;s mass. These oscillating clouds produce quasi-monochromatic, long-duration gravitational waves that may be detectable by ground-based or space-based gravitational wave detectors. We discuss the capability of a new long-duration signal tracking method, based on a hidden Markov model, to detect gravitational wave signals generated by ultralight vector boson clouds, including cases where the signal frequency evolution timescale is much shorter than that of a typical continuous wave signal. We quantify the detection horizon distances for vector boson clouds with current- and next-generation ground-based detectors. We demonstrate that vector clouds hosted by black holes with mass $\\gtrsim 60 M_{\\odot}$ and spin $\\gtrsim 0.6$ are within the reach of current-generation detectors up to a luminosity distance of $\\sim 1$ Gpc. This search method enables one to target vector boson clouds around remnant black holes from compact binary mergers detected by gravitational-wave detectors. We discuss the impact of the sky localization of the merger events and demonstrate that a typical remnant black hole reasonably well-localized by the current generation detector network is accessible in a follow-up search.\n",

The 10-cm-diameter Si(Li) detectors developed for the General Antiparticle Spectrometer (GAPS) balloon-borne <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> experiment are novel particularly for their requirements of low cost, large sensitive area (~10 m$^2$ for the full 1440-detector array), high temperatures (near -40$\\,^\\circ$C), and energy resolution below 4 keV FWHM for 20--100-keV x-rays. Previous works have discussed the manufacturing, passivation, and small-scale testing of prototype GAPS Si(Li) detectors. Here we show for the first time the results from detailed characterization of over 1100 flight detectors, illustrating the consistent intrinsic low-noise performance of a large sample of GAPS detectors. This work demonstrates the feasibility of large-area and low-cost Si(Li) detector arrays for next-generation astrophysics and nuclear physics applications.\n",

The boosted <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">Dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">Matter</span> flux at the edge of the Earth&#39;s atmosphere is expected to be pointing to the Galactic Center, with a flux 15 to 20 times larger than in the transverse direction.\n",
      "21        We investigate the reach of future gravitational wave (GW) detectors in probing inflaton couplings with visible sector particles that can either be bosonic or fermionic in nature. Assuming reheating takes place through perturbative quantum production from vacuum in presence of classical inflaton background field, we find that the spectral energy density of the primordial GW generated during inflation becomes sensitive to inflaton-<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> coupling. We conclude, obeying bounds from Big Bang Nucleosysthesis and Cosmic Microwave Background, that, e.g., inflaton-scalar couplings of the order of $\\sim\\mathcal{O}(10^{-20})$ GeV fall within the sensitivity range of several proposed GW detector facilities. However, this prediction is sensitive to the size of the inflationary scale, nature of the inflaton-<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> interaction and shape of the potential during reheating. Having found the time-dependent effective inflaton decay width, we also discuss its implications for <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> (DM) production from the thermal plasma via UV freeze-in during reheating. It is shown, that one can reproduce the observed DM abundance for its mass up to several PeVs, depending on the dimension of the operator connecting DM with the thermal bath and the associated scale of the UV physics. Thus we promote primordial GW to observables sensitive to feebly coupled inflaton, which is very challenging if not impossible to test in conventional particle physics laboratories or astrophysical measurements.\n",
      "22        We argue that demanding a consistent cosmological history, including the absence of domain walls and strongly interacting relics at the Peccei-Quinn scale, singles out two concrete realizations of hadronic QCD axions as viable <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> models. These realizations generally feature flavor-violating axion couplings to Standard Model quarks that are unsuppressed at low energies. As a consequence, experiments looking for flavor-violating hadronic processes involving the axion can be sensitive probes of QCD axion <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> models. In particular, we show that the NA62 and KOTO experiments could detect the $K\\rightarrowπ+ a$ decay for axions consistent with the observed <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> abundance via the post-inflationary misalignment mechanism.\n",
      "23        The mean <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> density within the turnaround radius, which is the boundary that separates a nonexpanding structure from the Hubble flow, was recently proposed as a novel cosmological probe. According to the spherical collapse model, the evolution with cosmic time of this turnaround density, $\\rm ρ_{ta}(z)$, can be used to determine both $\\rm Ω_m$ and $Ω_Λ$, independently of any other currently used probe. The properties of $\\rm ρ_{ta}$ predicted by the spherical collapse model were also shown to persist in the presence of full three-dimensional effects in $\\rm Λ$CDM N-body cosmological simulations when considering galaxy clusters at the present time, $z=0$. However, a small offset was discovered between the spherical-collapse prediction of the value of $ρ_{ta}$ at $z=0$ and its value measured in simulations. In this letter, we explore whether this offset evolves with cosmic time; whether it differs in different cosmologies; whether its origin can be confidently identified; and whether it can be corrected. We found that the offset does evolve slightly with redshift, and that it correlates strongly with the deviation from spherical symmetry of the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halo distribution inside and outside of the turnaround radius. We used an appropriate metric to quantify deviations in the environment of a structure from spherical symmetry. We found that using this metric, we can construct a sphericity-selected sample of halos for which the offset of $ρ_{ta}$ from the spherical collapse prediction is zero, independently of redshift and cosmology. We found that a sphericity-selected halo sample allows us to recover the simulated cosmology, and we conclude that the turnaround density evolution indeed encodes the cosmology in N-body simulations.\n",
      "24        We present a new suite of over 1,500 cosmological N-body simulations with varied Warm <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">Dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">Matter</span> (WDM) models ranging from 2.5 to 30 keV. We use these simulations to train Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to infer WDM particle masses from images of DM field data. Our fiducial setup can make accurate predictions of the WDM particle mass up to 7.5 keV at a 95% confidence level from small maps that cover an area of (25 h$^{-1}$ Mpc)$^2$. We vary the image resolution, simulation resolution, redshift, and cosmology of our fiducial setup to better understand how our model is making predictions. Using these variations, we find that our models are most dependent on simulation resolution, minimally dependent on image resolution, not systematically dependent on redshift, and robust to varied cosmologies. We also find that an important feature to distinguish between WDM models is present with a linear size between 100 and 200 h$^{-1}$ kpc. We compare our fiducial model to one trained on the power spectrum alone and find that our field-level model can make 2x more precise predictions and can make accurate predictions to 2x as massive WDM particle masses when used on the same data. Overall, we find that the field-level data can be used to accurately differentiate between WDM models and contain more information than is captured by the power spectrum. This technique can be extended to more complex DM models and opens up new opportunities to explore alternative DM models in a cosmological environment.\n",
      "25        The properties of globular clusters (GCs) contain valuable information of their host galaxies and <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span>-<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halos. In the remarkable example of ultra-diffuse galaxy, NGC5846-UDG1, the GC population exhibits strong radial mass segregation, indicative of dynamical-friction-driven orbital decay, which opens the possibility of using imaging data alone to constrain the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span>-<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> content of the galaxy. To explore this possibility, we develop a semi-analytical model of GC evolution, which starts from the initial mass function, the initial structure-mass relation, and the initial spatial distribution of the GC progenitors, and follows the effects of dynamical friction, tidal evolution, and two-body relaxation. Using Markov Chain Monte Carlo, we forward-model the GCs in a NGC5846-UDG1-like potential to match the observed GC mass, size, and spatial distributions, and to constrain the profile of the host halo and the origin of the GCs. We find that, with the assumptions of zero mass segregation when the star clusters were born, NGC5846-UDG1 is <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span>-<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> poor compared to what is expected from stellar-to-halo-mass relations, and its halo concentration is low, irrespective of having a cuspy or a cored halo profile. Its GC population has an initial spatial distribution more extended than the smooth stellar distribution. We discuss the results in the context of scaling laws of galaxy-halo connections, and warn against naively using the GC-abundance-halo-mass relation to infer the halo mass of UDGs. Our model is generally applicable to GC-rich dwarf galaxies, and is publicly available at https://github.com/JiangFangzhou/GCevo.\n",
      "26        The Epoch of Reionization (EoR) neutral Hydrogen (HI) 21-cm signal evolves significantly along the line-of-sight (LoS) due to the light-cone (LC) effect. It is important to accurately incorporate this in simulations in order to correctly interpret the signal. 21-cm LC simulations are typically produced by stitching together slices from a finite number $(N_{\\rm RS})$ of &#39;&#39;reionization snapshot&#39;&#39;, each corresponding to a different stage of reionization. In this paper, we have quantified the errors in the 21-cm LC simulation due to the finite value of $N_{\\rm RS}$. We show that this can introduce large discontinuities $(&gt; 200 \\%)$ at the stitching boundaries when $N_{\\rm RS}$ is small $(= 2,4)$ and the mean neutral fraction jumps by $δ\\bar{x}_{\\rm HI} = 0.2,0.1$ respectively at the stitching boundaries. This drops to $17 \\%$ for $N_{\\rm RS} = 13$ where $δ\\bar{x}_{\\rm HI}=0.02$. We present and also validate a method for mitigating this error by increasing $N_{\\rm RS}$ without a proportional increase in the computational costs which are mainly incurred in generating the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> and halo density fields. Our method generates these fields only at a few redshifts, and interpolates them to generate reionization snapshots at closely spaced redshifts. We use this to generate 21-cm LC simulations with $N_{\\rm RS} = 26,51,101$ and $201$, and show that the errors go down as $N_{\\rm RS}^{-1}$.\n",
      "27        The advent of gravitational wave astronomy has seen a huge influx of new predictions for potential discoveries of beyond the Standard Model fields. The coupling of all fundamental fields to gravity, together with its dominance on large scales, makes gravitational physics a rich laboratory to study fundamental physics. This holds especially true for the search for the elusive <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> photon, a promising <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> candidate. The <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> photon is predicted to generate instabilities in a rotating black hole spacetime, birthing a macroscopic Bose-Einstein condensate. These condensates can especially form around super massive black holes, modifying the dynamical inspiralling process. This then opens another window to leverage future space-borne gravitational wave antennas to join the hunt for the elusive <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> particle. This study builds a preliminary model for the gravitational waveform emitted by such a dressed extreme mass-ratio inspiral. Comparing these waveforms to the vacuum scenario allows projections to the potential constrainability on the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> photon mass by space-borne gravitational wave antennas. The superradiant instability of a massive vector field on a Kerr background is calculated and the modification to the dynamics of an inspiralling solar mass-scale compact object is determined with approximations on the backreaction effect of the cloud on the compact object. The end result is the projection that the LISA mission should be able to constrain the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> photon mass using extreme mass ratio inspirals in the range $[1.8 \\times 10^{-17}, 4.47 \\times 10^{-16}]$ eV.\n",
      "28        Recent observations made by the JWST have revealed a number of massive galaxies at high redshift ($z$). The presence of these galaxies appears at odds with the current $Λ$CDM cosmology. Here we investigate the possibility of alleviating the tension by incorporating uncertainties from three sources in counting massive galaxies at high $z$: cosmic variance, error in stellar mass estimate, and contribution by backsplash. We find that each of the sources can significantly increase the cumulative stellar mass density $ρ_*(&gt;M_*)$ at the high-mass end, and the combination of them can boost the density by more than one order of magnitude. Assuming a star formation efficiency of $ε_* \\sim 0.5$, cosmic variance alone can reduce the tension to $2σ$ level, except the most massive galaxy at $z=8$. Including in addition a lognormal dispersion with a width of 0.3 dex in the stellar mass can bring the observed stellar mass density at $z \\sim 7 - 10$ to the $2σ$ range of the cosmic variance. The tension is completely eliminated when gas stripped from backsplash halos is also taken into account. Our results highlight the importance of fully modeling uncertainties when interpreting observational data of rare objects. We use the constrained simulation, ELUCID, to investigate the descendants of high $z$ massive galaxies. We find that a significant portion of these galaxies end up in massive halos with mass $M_{\\rm halo} &gt; 10^{13} h^{-1}M_\\odot $ at $z=0$. A large fraction of central galaxies in $M_{\\rm halo} \\geqslant 10^{14.5} h^{-1}M_\\odot$ halos today are predicted to contain significant amounts of ancient stars formed in massive galaxies at $z\\sim 8$. This prediction can be tested by studying the structure and stellar population of central galaxies in present-day massive clusters.\n",
      "29        Within the $Λ$CDM cosmology, <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> haloes are comprised of both a smooth component and a population of smaller, gravitationally bound subhaloes. These components are often treated as a single halo when halo properties, such as density profiles, are extracted from simulations. Recent work has shown that density profiles change substantially when subhalo mass is excluded. In this paper, we expand on this result by analysing the change in three specific host halo properties -- concentration ($c_{\\rm{NFW}}$), spin ($λ_{\\rm Bullock}$), and shape ($c/a$), -- when calculated only from the smooth component of the halo. This analysis is performed on both Milky Way-mass haloes and cluster-mass haloes in high-resolution, zoom-in, $N$-body simulations. We find that when subhaloes are excluded the median value of (1) $c_{\\rm{NFW}}$ is enhanced by $\\approx 38 \\pm 12\\%$ and $\\approx 88 \\pm 7.7\\%$ for Milky Way mass ($10^{12.1}\\,\\text{M}_\\odot$) and cluster mass ($10^{14.8}\\,\\text{M}_\\odot$) haloes respectively, (2) $λ_{\\rm Bullock}$ is reduced for Milky Way mass by $\\approx 16 \\pm 6.8\\%$ and cluster mass haloes by $\\approx 32 \\pm 8.9\\%$. Additionally, with the removal of subhaloes, cluster mass haloes tend to become more spherical as the ratio of minor-to-major axis, $c/a$, increases by $\\approx 12 \\pm 4\\%$, whereas Milky Way mass haloes remain approximately the same shape with $c/a$ changed by $\\approx 1.2 \\pm 5.6\\%$. The fractional change of each of these properties depends primarily on the amount of mass that is removed from the halo system and, to a lesser extent, mass accretion history. Our findings demonstrate that the properties of the smooth components of <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> haloes are biased relative to the total mass of the halo including subhaloes.\n",
      "30        In order to test active galactic nucleus (AGN) unification and evolutionary models, we measured the AGN clustering properties as a function of AGN obscuration defined in terms of hydrogen column density, $N_{\\rm H}$. In addition to measuring the clustering of unobscured ($N_{\\rm H} &lt; 10^{22}\\,{\\rm cm}^{-2}$) and moderately obscured ($10^{22} \\leq N_{\\rm H} &lt; 10^{23.5}$) AGNs, we also targeted highly obscured sources ($N_{\\rm H}\\geq 10^{23.5}$) up to redshifts of $z=3$. We have compiled one of the largest samples of X-ray-selected AGNs from a total of eight deep XMM/Chandra surveys. We measured the clustering as a function of both AGN obscuration and redshift using the projected two-point correlation function, $w_{\\rm p}(r_{\\rm p})$. We modeled the large-scale clustering signal, measured the AGN bias, $b(z, N_{\\rm H})$, and interpreted it in terms of the typical AGN host <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halo, $M_{\\rm halo}(z, N_{\\rm H}$). We find no significant dependence of AGN clustering on obscuration, suggesting similar typical masses of the hosting halos as a function of $N_{\\rm H}$. This result matches expectations of AGN unification models, in which AGN obscuration depends mainly on the viewing angle of the obscuring torus. We measured, for the first time, the clustering of highly obscured AGNs and find that these objects reside in halos with typical mass $\\log M_{\\rm halo} = 12.98_{-0.22}^{+0.17} [h^{-1} M_\\odot]$ ($12.28_{-0.19}^{+0.13}$) at low $z \\sim 0.7$ (high $z \\sim 1.8$) redshifts. We find that irrespective of obscuration, an increase in AGN bias with redshift is slower than the expectation for a constant halo mass and instead follows the growth rate of halos, known as the passive evolution track. This implies that for those AGNs the clustering is mainly driven by the mass growth rate of the hosting halos and galaxies across cosmic time.\n",
      "31        Mergers between galaxy clusters are an important stage in the formation of the large-scale structure of the Universe. Some of the mergers show a spectacular bow shock that formed as a result of recent passage of a smaller cluster through a bigger one, the classic example of this being the so-called bullet cluster. In this paper, I describe ten examples of interacting clusters identified among 200 of the most massive objects, with total masses above $1.4 \\times 10^{14}$ M$_{\\odot}$, from the IllustrisTNG300 simulation by searching for prominent bow shocks in their temperature maps. Despite different mass ratios of the two merging clusters, the events are remarkably similar in many respects. In all cases, the companion cluster passed close to the main one only once, between 0.9 and 0.3 Gyr ago, with the pericenter distance of 100-530 kpc and a velocity of up to 3400 km s$^{-1}$. The subcluster, typically an order of magnitude smaller in mass than the main cluster before the interaction, loses most of its <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> and gas in the process. The displacement between the collisionless part of the remnant and the bow shock is such that the remnant typically lags behind the shock or coincides with it, with a single exception of the merger occurring with the largest velocity. Usually about 1% of the gas cells in the merging clusters are shocked, and the median Mach numbers of these gas cells are around two. Due to the relatively small size of the simulation box, no close analog of the bullet cluster was found, but I identified one case that is similar in terms of mass, velocity, and displacement. The presented cases bear more resemblance to less extreme observed interacting clusters such as A520 and Coma.\n",
      "32        Microscopic horizonless relics could form in the early universe either directly through gravitational collapse or as stable remnants of the Hawking evaporation of primordial black holes. In both cases they completely or partially evade cosmological constraints arising from Hawking evaporation and in certain mass ranges can explain the entirety of the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>. We systematically explore the stochastic gravitational-wave background associated with the formation of microscopic <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span>-<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> relics in various scenarios, adopting an agnostic approach and discussing the limitations introduced by existing constraints, possible ways to circumvent the latter, and expected astrophysical foregrounds.

      "33        In direct <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> (DM) detection via scattering off the electrons, the momentum transfer plays a crucial role. Previous work showed that for self-interacting DM, if the DM particle has a size (the so-called puffy DM), the radius effect could dominate the momentum transfer and become another source of velocity dependence for self-scattering cross section. In this work we investigate the direct detection of puffy DM particles with different radii through electron recoil. We find that comparing with the available experimental exclusion limits dominated by the mediator effect for XENON10, XENON100 and XENON1T, the constraints on the puffy DM-electron scattering cross-section become much weaker for large radius DM particles. For small-radius DM particles, the constraints remain similar to the point-like DM case.\n",
      "34        Boson stars are gravitationally bound objects that arise in ultralight <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> models and form in the centers of galactic halos or axion miniclusters. We systematically study the excitations of a boson star, taking into account the mixing between positive and negative frequencies introduced by gravity. We show that the spectrum contains zero-energy modes in the monopole and dipole sectors resulting from spontaneous symmetry breaking by the boson star background. We analyze the general properties of the eigenmodes and derive their orthogonality and completeness conditions which have non-standard form due to the positive-negative frequency mixing. The eigenvalue problem is solved numerically for the first few energy levels in different multipole sectors and the results are compared to the solutions of the Schrödinger equation in fixed boson star gravitational potential. The two solutions differ significantly for the lowest modes, but get close for higher levels. We further confirm the normal mode spectrum in 3D wave simulations where we inject perturbations with different multipoles. As an application of the normal mode solutions, we compute the matrix element entering the evaporation rate of a boson star immersed in a hot axion gas. The computation combines the use of exact wavefunctions for the low-lying bound states and of the Schrödinger approximation for the high-energy excitations.\n",
      "35        If long-range attractive forces exist and are stronger than gravity then cosmic halo formation can begin in the radiation-dominated era. We study a simple realization of this effect in a system where <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> fermions have Yukawa interactions mediated by scalar particles, analogous to the Higgs boson in the standard model. We develop a self-consistent description of the system including exact background dynamics of the scalar field, and precise modelling of the fermion density fluctuations. For the latter, we provide accurate approximations for the linear growth as well as quantitative modelling of the nonlinear evolution using N-body simulations. We find that halo formation occurs exponentially fast and on scales substantially larger than simple estimates predict. The final fate of these halos remains uncertain, but could be annihilation, <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> stars, primordial black holes, or even the existence of galaxy-sized halos at <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>-radiation equality. More generally, our results demonstrate the importance of mapping scalar-mediated interactions onto structure formation outcomes and constraints for beyond the standard model theories.\n",
      "36        Recent analysis on the stellar kinematics of ultra-faint dwarf (UFD) galaxies has put a stringent upper limit on the self-scattering cross section of <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>, i.e., $σ/m&lt;{\\cal O}(0.1)\\,{\\rm cm^2/g}$ at the scattering velocity of ${\\cal O}(10)\\,{\\rm km/s}$. Resonant self-interacting <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> (rSIDM) is one possibility that can be consistent with the UFDs and explain the low central densities of rotation-supported galaxies; the cross section is resonantly enhanced to be $σ/m = {\\cal O}(1)\\,{\\rm cm^2/g}$ around the scattering velocity of ${\\cal O}(100)\\,{\\rm km/s}$ while being suppressed at lower velocities. To further assess this possibility, since the inferred <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> distribution of halos from astrophysical observations is usually compared to that in constant-cross section SIDM (cSIDM), whether the structures of rSIDM halos can be approximated by the cSIDM halo profiles needs to be clarified. In this work, we employ the grovothermal fluid method to investigate the structural evolution of rSIDM halos in a wide mass range. We find that except for halos in a specific mass range, the present structures of rSIDM halos are virtually indistinguishable from those of the cSIDM halos. For halos in the specific mass range, the resonant self-scattering renders a break in their density profile. We demonstrate how such a density-profile break appears in astrophysical observations, e.g., rotation curves and line-of-sight velocity dispersion profiles. We show that for halos above the specific mass range, the density-profile break thermalizes to disappear before the present. We demonstrate that such distinctive thermalization dynamics can leave imprints on the orbital classes of stars with similar ages and metallicities.\n",
      "37        The E-type $α$-attractor models of single-field inflation were generalized further in order to accommodate production of primordial black holes (PBH) via adding a near-inflection point to the inflaton scalar potential at smaller scales, in good agreement with measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation. A minimal number of new parameters was used but their fine-tuning was maximized in order to increase possible masses of PBH formed during an ultra-slow-roll phase leading to a large enhancement of the power spectrum of scalar (curvature) perturbations by 6 or 7 orders of magnitude against the power spectrum of perturbations observed in CMB. It was found that extreme fine-tuning of the parameters in our models can lead to a formation of the Earth-size PBH with the masses of approximately $10^{27}$ g, still in agreement with CMB observations. Quantum corrections are known to lead to the perturbative upper bound on the amplitude of large scalar perturbations responsible for PBH production. The quantum (one-loop) corrections in our models were found to be suppressed by one order of magnitude for PBH with the masses of approximately $10^{19}$ g, which may form the whole <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> in the Universe.\n",

We study the requirements the model&#39;s parameters have to fulfill in order to reproduce the measured DM relic abundance through two possible production mechanisms in the early universe, freeze-in and misalignment, both during a standard radiation-dominated era and early <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> domination. We then study possible signals of type-II majoron DM and the present and expected constraints on the parameter space that can be obtained from cosmological observations, direct detection experiments, and present and future searches for decaying DM at neutrino telescopes and cosmic-ray experiments. We find that -- depending on the majoron mass, the production mechanism, and the value of the vacuum expectation value of the type-II triplet -- all of the three decay modes (photons, electrons, neutrinos) of majoron DM particles can yield observable signals at future indirect searches for DM. Furthermore, in a corner of the parameter space, detection of majoron DM is possible through electron recoil at running and future direct detection experiments.\n",
      "39        Running vacuum models and viscous <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> scenarios beyond perfect fluid idealization are two appealing theoretical strategies that have been separately studied as alternatives to solve some problems rooted in the $Λ$CDM cosmological model. In this paper, we combine these two notions in a single cosmological setting and investigate their cosmological implications, paying particular attention in the interplay between these two constituents in different cosmological periods. Specifically, we consider a well-studied running vacuum model inspired by renormalization group, and a recently proposed general parameterization for the bulk viscosity $ξ$. By employing dynamical system analysis, we explore the physical aspects of the new phase space that emerges from the combined models and derive stability conditions that ensure complete cosmological dynamics. We identify four distinct classes of models and find that the critical points of the phase space are non-trivially renewed compared to the single scenarios. We then proceed, in a joint and complementary way to the dynamical system analysis, with a detailed numerical exploration to quantify the impact of both the running parameter and the bulk viscosity coefficient on the cosmological evolution. Thus, for some values of the model parameters, numerical solutions show qualitative differences from the $Λ$CDM model, which is phenomenologically appealing in light of cosmological observations.\n",
      "40        The intrinsic alignment (IA) of observed galaxy shapes with the underlying cosmic web is a source of contamination in weak lensing surveys. Sensitive methods to identify the IA signal will therefore need to be included in the upcoming weak lensing analysis pipelines. Hydrodynamical cosmological simulations allow us to directly measure the intrinsic ellipticities of galaxies and thus provide a powerful approach to predict and understand the IA signal. Here we employ the novel, large-volume hydrodynamical simulation MTNG740, a product of the MillenniumTNG (MTNG) project, to study the IA of galaxies. We measure the projected correlation functions between the intrinsic shape/shear of galaxies and various tracers of large-scale structure, $w_{+g},\\ w_{+m},\\ w_{++}$ over the radial range $r_{\\rm p} \\in [0.02 , 200]\\,h^{-1}{\\rm Mpc}$ and at redshifts $z=0.0$, $0.5$ and $1.0$. We detect significant signal-to-noise IA signals with the density field for both elliptical and spiral galaxies. We also find significant intrinsic shear-shear correlations for ellipticals. We further examine correlations of the intrinsic shape of galaxies with the local tidal field. Here we find a significant IA signal for elliptical galaxies assuming a linear model. We also detect a weak IA signal for spiral galaxies under a quadratic tidal torquing model. Lastly, we measure the alignment between central galaxies and their host <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span>-<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halos, finding small to moderate misalignments between their principal axes that decline with halo mass.\n",

We explore the lensing maps over a large dynamic range in simulation mass and angular resolution, allowing us to establish a clear assessment of numerical convergence. By comparing full physics hydrodynamical simulations with corresponding <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span>-<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>-only runs we quantify the impact of baryonic physics on the most important weak lensing statistics. Likewise, we predict the impact of massive neutrinos reliably far into the non-linear regime. We also demonstrate that the &#34;fixed &amp; paired&#34; variance suppression technique increases the statistical robustness of the simulation predictions on large scales not only for time slices but also for continuously output lightcone data. We find that both baryonic and neutrino effects substantially impact weak lensing shear measurements, with the latter dominating over the former on large angular scales. Thus, both effects must explicitly be included to obtain sufficiently accurate predictions for stage IV lensing surveys. Reassuringly, our results agree accurately with other simulation results where available, supporting the promise of simulation modelling for precision cosmology far into the non-linear regime.\n",
      "42        An era of kination occurs when the Universe&#39;s energy density is dominated by a fast-rolling scalar field. <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">Dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> that is thermally produced during an era of kination requires larger-than-canonical annihilation cross sections to generate the observed <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> relic abundance. Furthermore, <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> density perturbations that enter the horizon during an era of kination grow linearly with the scale factor prior to radiation domination. We show how the resulting enhancement to the small-scale <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> power spectrum increases the microhalo abundance and boosts the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> annihilation rate. We then use gamma-ray observations to constrain thermal <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> production during kination. The annihilation boost factor depends on the minimum halo mass, which is determined by the small-scale cutoff in the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> power spectrum. Therefore, observational limits on the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> annihilation rate imply a minimum cutoff scale for a given <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> particle mass and kination scenario. For <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> that was once in thermal equilibrium with the Standard Model, this constraint establishes a maximum allowed kinetic decoupling temperature for the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>. This bound on the decoupling temperature implies that the growth of perturbations during kination cannot appreciably boost the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> annihilation rate if <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> was once in thermal equilibrium with the Standard Model.\n",
      "43        We present the measurement of total and stellar/<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> decomposed mass density profile around a sample of galaxy groups and clusters with dynamical masses derived from integral-field stellar kinematics from the MaNGA survey in Paper~I and weak lensing derived from the DECaLS imaging survey. Combining the two data sets enables accurate measurement of the radial density distribution from several kpc to Mpc scales. Intriguingly, we find that the excess surface density derived from stellar kinematics in the inner region cannot be explained by simply adding an NFW <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halo extrapolated from lensing measurement at a larger scale to a stellar mass component derived from the NASA-Sloan Atlas (NSA) catalog. We find that a good fit to both data sets requires a stellar mass normalization about 3 times higher than that derived from the NSA catalog, which would require an unrealistically too-heavy initial mass function for stellar mass estimation. If we keep the stellar mass normalization to that of the NSA catalog but allow a varying inner <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> density profile, we obtain an asymptotic slope of $γ_{\\rm gnfw}$= $1.82_{-0.25}^{+0.15}$, $γ_{\\rm gnfw}$= $1.48_{-0.41}^{+0.20}$ for the group bin and the cluster bin respectively, significantly steeper than the NFW case. We also compare the total mass inner density slopes with those from Illustris-TNG300 and find that the values from the simulation are lower than the observation by at least $3σ$ level.\n",
      "44        We present dynamical scaling relations, combined with the stellar population properties, for a subsample of about 6000 nearby galaxies with the most reliable dynamical models extracted from the full MaNGA sample of 10K galaxies. We show that the inclination-corrected mass plane (MP) for both early-type galaxies (ETGs) and late-type galaxies (LTGs), which links dynamical mass, projected half-light radius $R_{\\rm e}$, and the second stellar velocity moment $σ_{\\rm e}$ within $R_{\\rm e}$, satisfies the virial theorem and is even tighter than the uncorrected one. We find a clear parabolic relation between $\\lg(M/L)(&lt;R_{\\rm e})$, the total mass-to-light ratio within a sphere of radius $R_{\\rm e}$, and $\\lgσ_{\\rm e}$, with the $M/L$ increasing with $σ_{\\rm e}$ and for older stellar populations. However, the relation for ETGs is linear and the one for the youngest galaxies is constant. We confirm and improve the relation between average logarithmic total density slopes $γ_{_{\\rm T}}$ and $σ_{\\rm e}$: $γ_{_{\\rm T}}$ become steeper with increasing $σ_{\\rm e}$ until $\\lg(σ_{\\rm e}/{\\rm km\\,s^{-1}})\\approx 2.2$ and then remain constant around $γ_{_{\\rm T}}\\approx -2.2$. The $γ_{_{\\rm T}}-σ_{\\rm e}$ variation is larger for LTGs than ETGs. At fixed $σ_{\\rm e}$ the total density profiles steepen with galaxy age and for ETGs. We find generally low <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> fractions, median $f_{\\rm DM}(&lt;R_{\\rm e})=8$ per cent, within a sphere of radius $R_{\\rm e}$. However, we find that $f_{\\rm DM}(&lt;R_{\\rm e})$ depends on $σ_{\\rm e}$ better than stellar mass: <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> increases to a median $f_{\\rm DM}=33$ percent for galaxies with $σ_{\\rm e}\\lesssim100{\\rm km\\,s^{-1}}$. The increased $f_{\\rm DM}(&lt;R_{\\rm e})$ at low $σ_{\\rm e}$ explains the parabolic $\\lg(M/L)(&lt;R_{\\rm e})-\\lgσ_{\\rm e}$ relation.\n",
      "45        We analyze the global stellar population, radial gradients and non-parametric star formation history of $\\sim 10$K galaxies from the MaNGA Survey final data release 17 (DR17), based on stellar population synthesis and full-spectrum fitting, and relate them with dynamical properties of galaxies. We confirm that stellar population correlates with stellar velocity dispersion $σ_{\\rm e}$ better than with stellar mass $M_{\\ast}$, but also find that younger galaxies are more metal-poor at fixed $σ_{\\rm e}$. Stellar age, metallicity, and mass-to-light ratio $M_{\\ast}/L$ all decrease with galaxy rotation, while radial gradients become more negative (i.e., younger, more metal-poor, and lower $M_{\\ast}/L$ in the outskirts). The trend between metallicity gradients and rotation reverses for slow rotators, which stand out for their more negative metallicity gradients than faster-rotating galaxies. We highlight a population of massive disk galaxies on the green valley, on the $(σ_{\\rm e},\\rm Age)$ plane, that show steep negative age and metallicity gradients, consistent with their old central bulges surrounded by young star-forming disks and metal-poor gas accretion. Galaxies with high $σ_{\\rm e}$, steep total mass-density slope, low <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> fraction, high $M_{\\ast}/L$, and high metallicity have the highest star-formation rate at earlier times, and are currently quenched. We discover a population of low-mass star-forming galaxies with low rotation but physically distinct from the massive slow rotators. A catalogue of the population properties is provided publicly.\n",
      "46        This is the first paper in our series on the combined analysis of the Dynamics and stellar Population (DynPop) for the MaNGA survey in the final SDSS Data Release 17 (DR17). Here we present a catalogue of dynamically-determined quantities for over 10000 nearby galaxies based on integral-field stellar kinematics from the MaNGA survey. The dynamical properties are extracted using the axisymmetric Jeans Anisotropic Modelling (JAM) method, which was previously shown to be the most accurate for this kind of study. We assess systematic uncertainties using eight dynamical models with different assumptions. We use two orientations of the velocity ellipsoid: either cylindrically-aligned JAM$_{\\rm cyl}$ or spherically-aligned JAM$_{\\rm sph}$. We also make four assumptions for the models&#39; <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> vs. luminous <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> distributions: (1) mass-follows-light, (2) free NFW <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> halo, (3) cosmologically-constrained NFW halo, (4) generalized NFW <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> halo, i.e. with free inner slope. In this catalogue, we provide the quantities related to the mass distributions (e.g. the density slopes and enclosed mass within a sphere of a given radius for total mass, stellar mass, and <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> mass components). We also provide the complete models which can be used to compute the full luminous and mass distribution of each galaxy. Additionally, we visually assess the qualities of the models to help with model selections. We estimate the observed scatter in the measured quantities which decreases as expected with improvements in quality. For the best data quality, we find a remarkable consistency of measured quantities between different models, highlighting the robustness of the results.\n",
      "47        What is the highest energy at which gravitons can be observed? We address this question by studying graviton-to-photon conversion - the inverse-Gertsenshtein effect - in the magnetic field of the Milky Way. We find that above $\\sim 1~\\mbox{PeV}$ the effective photon mass grows large enough to quench the conversion rate. The induced photon flux is comparable to the sensitivity of LHAASO to a diffuse $γ$-ray background, but only for graviton abundances of order $Ω_{\\text{gw}} h^2_0 \\sim 1$. In the future, owing to a better understanding of $γ$-ray backgrounds, larger effective areas and longer observation times, sub-PeV shimmering gravitons with a realistic abundance of $Ω_{\\text{gw}} h^2_0 \\sim 0.01$ could be detected. We show that this is achieved in a cosmologically-motivated scenario of post-recombination superheavy <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> decay. Therefore, the sub-PeV range might be the ultimate energy frontier at which gravitons can be observed.\n",
      "48        The relation between the total mass contained in the globular clusters of a galaxy and the mass of its <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halo has been found observationally to be nearly linear over five decades of mass. However, the high-mass end of this relation is not well determined from previous data and shows large scatter. We analyze the globular cluster systems (GCSs) of a homogeneous sample of 11 brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) through DOLPHOT photometry of their deep Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images in the F814W filter. We standardize the definition of $M_{GCS}$, the total GCS mass, by using the GC total population within a limiting radius of $0.1 R_{virial}$, while the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span>-<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halo mass $M_h$ is determined from the weak-lensing calibration of $M_h$ versus $M_{bary}$. When these 11 BCGs are added to the previously studied homogeneous catalogue of Virgo member galaxies, a total value for $η= M_{GCS}/M_h$ is found to be $(3.0\\pm1.8_{internal})\\times10^{-5}$, slightly higher than previous estimates but with much reduced uncertainty. Perhaps more importantly, the results suggest that the relation continues to have a near-linear shape at the highest galaxy masses, strongly reinforcing the conclusion that accreted GCs make a major contribution to the GC populations at high galaxy mass.\n",
      "49        We introduce an analytic surface density profile for <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halos that accurately reproduces the structure of simulated halos of mass $M_{\\rm vir} = 10^{7-11}\\ M_\\odot$, making it useful for modeling line-of-sight perturbers in strong gravitational lensing models. The two-parameter function has an analytic deflection potential and is more accurate than the projected Navarro, Frenk &amp; White (NFW) profile commonly adopted at this mass scale for perturbers, especially at the small radii of most relevant for lensing perturbations. Using a characteristic radius, $R_{-1}$, where the log slope of surface density is equal to $-1$, and an associated surface density, $Σ_{-1}$, we can represent the expected lensing signal from line-of-sight halos statistically, for an ensemble of halo orientations, using a distribution of {\\em projected concentration} parameters, $\\mathcal{C}_{\\rm vir} := r_{\\rm vir}/ R_{-1}$. Though an individual halo can have a projected concentration that varies with orientation with respect to the observer, the range of projected concentrations correlates with the usual three-dimensional halo concentration in a way that enables ease of use.\n",
      "50        Axions and axion-like particles (ALPs) are a prominent <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> candidate, drawing motivation in part from the axiverse of string theory. Axion-like particles can also arise as composite degrees of freedom of a <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> sector, for example, as <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> pions in <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> Quantum Chromo-Dynamics. In a <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> Standard Model (SM) wherein all 6 quark flavors are light while the photon is massive, one finds a rich low-energy spectrum of stable and ultralight particles, in the form of neutral and charged <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> scalars, and complex neutral scalars analogous to the SM kaon, with mass splittings determined by the mass and charge of the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> quarks. The model finds a natural portal to the visible sector via kinetic coupling of the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> and visible photons, and consequent millicharges for <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>. The <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> can be a mixture of all these ultralight bosonic degrees of freedom, and exhibit both parity-even and parity-odd interactions, making the theory testable at a wide variety of experiments.

      "51        The most luminous quasars at $z &gt; 6$ are suspected to be both highly clustered and reside in the most massive <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halos in the early Universe, making them prime targets to search for galaxy overdensities and/or protoclusters. We search for Lyman-break dropout-selected galaxies using HST WFC3/ACS broadband imaging in the fields of three $6 &lt; z &lt; 7$ quasars, as well as their simultaneously observed coordinated-parallel fields, and constrain their photometric redshifts using EAZY. One field, J0305-3150, shows a volume density 10$\\times$ higher than the blank-field UV luminosity function (UVLF) at M$_{UV} &lt; -20$, with tentative evidence of a 3$σ$ overdensity in its parallel field located 15 cMpc away. Another field, J2054-0005, shows an angular overdensity within 500 ckpc from the quasar but still consistent with UVLF predictions within 3$σ$, while the last field, J2348-3054, shows no enhancement. We discuss methods for reducing uncertainty in overdensity measurements when using photometric selection and show that we can robustly select LBGs consistent with being physically associated with the quasar, corroborated by existing JWST/NIRCam WFSS data in the J0305 field. Even accounting for incompleteness, the overdensities in J0305 and J2054 are higher for brighter galaxies at short angular separations, suggesting preferential enhancement of more massive galaxies in the immediate vicinity of the quasar. Finally, we compare the LBG population with previously-identified [CII] and mm-continuum companions; the LBG overdensities are not accompanied by an enhanced number of dusty galaxies, suggesting that the overdense quasar fields are not in the bursty star-forming phase sometimes seen in high-redshift protoclusters.\n"

The effects of DM on NS properties, including the mass-radius relation, the moment of inertia, and tidal deformability, are calculated by varying its fraction. The study found that the EOS becomes softer with increasing DM momentum, and the DM has marginal effects on nuclear <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> properties, except for the EOSs and binding energy per particle. The study also calculated the properties of isolated, static, and rotating DM admixed NS and found that the DM has significant effects on both static and rotating NS. We have also observed that a tiny amount of DM can accumulate inside the NS, and more amount of it makes the NS unstable. The study also suggests that the secondary component might be a NS with DM content if the underlying nuclear EOS is sufficiently stiff. The $f$-mode oscillations of the DM admixed hyperon stars are calculated and found that there exist a correlation between canonical $f$-mode frequency and the dimensionless tidal deformability parameter ($Λ_{1.4}$) and we have put a constraint on $f$-mode frequency using GW170817 data. Finally, we have calculated the DM admixed binary NS properties and found that the binary system becomes less deformed and sustains more time in its inspiral phases with the addition of DM. Therefore, we suggest that one can take DM inside the compact objects while modeling the inspiral waveforms for the BNS systems.\n",
      "3        Radiative emissions from electrons and positrons generated by <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> (DM) annihilation or decay are one of the most investigated signals in indirect searches of WIMPs. Ideal targets must have large ratio of DM to baryonic <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>. However, such ``<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span>&#39;&#39; systems have a poorly known level of magnetic turbulence, which determines the residence time of the electrons and positrons and therefore also the strength of the expected signal. This typically leads to significant uncertainties in the derived DM bounds. In a novel approach, we compute the self-confinement of the DM-induced electrons and positrons. Indeed, they themselves generate irregularities in the magnetic field, thus setting a lower limit on the presence of the magnetic turbulence. We specifically apply this approach to dwarf spheroidal galaxies. Finally, by comparing the expected synchrotron emission with radio data from the direction of the Draco galaxy collected at the Giant Metre Radio Telescope, we show that the proposed approach can be used to set robust and competitive bounds on WIMP DM.\n",
      "4        The particle origin of <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> (DM) is still one of the main puzzles in modern physics. One of the most promising search strategy to detect DM at laboratories is through the indirect search of cosmic particles that are produced from DM annihilation in space. In particular, the flux of cosmic positrons has been measured with high precision by the AMS-02 experiment demonstrating that an excess above 10 GeV, with respect to the secondary production, is present. We study in this paper the possible DM origin of the positron excess finding the values of the DM mass $M$ and annihilation cross section $\\langle σv \\rangle$ that are needed to fit high-energy positron data. In particular, we find that for DM annihilating into $b\\bar{b}$ it is required to have $M=43$ TeV and $\\langle σv \\rangle = 10^{-21}$ cm$^3$/s while for $τ^+τ^-$ $M=2$ TeV and $\\langle σv \\rangle = 3\\times 10^{-23}$ cm$^3$/s. If DM produce positrons, they are expected to generate gamma rays from the center of the Milky Way and around dwarf galaxy satellites of the Galaxy. We thus combine the values for the DM mass and annihilation cross section obtained with the fit to AMS-02 positron data with the upper limits derived with the non-detection of $γ$ rays with HESS in the direction of the Galactic center and Fermi-LAT for the combined analysis of dwarf galaxies. The main result of the paper is that only DM annihilating into $μ^+ μ^-$ with a mass around 500 GeV and $\\langle σv \\rangle = 4\\times 10^{-24}$ cm$^3$/s can fit AMS-02 data and be compatible with the upper limits found with $γ$ rays. As for the $τ^+ τ^-$ ($b\\bar{b}$) channel, DM can contribute at most at a few tens $\\%$ (a few \\%) level.\n",

The GNOME experiment utilizes a worldwide network of shielded atomic magnetometers (and, more recently, comagnetometers) to search for spatially and temporally correlated signals due to torques on atomic spins from exotic fields of astrophysical origin.

      "7        Recent observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) are yielding tantalizing hints of an early population of massive, bright galaxies at $z &gt; 10$, with Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) observations indicating significant dust masses in place as early as $z\\sim 7$. To understand the implications of these observations, we use the DELPHI semi-analytic model that jointly tracks the assembly of <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halos and their constituent baryons, including the key processes of dust enrichment. Our model employs only two redshift- and mass-independent free parameters that are tuned against all available galaxy data at $z \\sim 5-9$ before it is used to make predictions up to $z \\sim 20$. Our key results are: (1) the model progressively under-predicts the observed ultraviolet luminosity function (UV LF) at $z &gt; 12$; observations at $z&gt;16$ lie close to, or even above, a &#34;maximal&#34; model where all available gas is turned into stars; (2) UV selection would miss 34% of the star formation rate density at $z \\sim 5$, decreasing to 17% by $z \\sim 10$ for bright galaxies with $\\rm{M_{UV}} &lt; -19$; (3) the dust mass ($M_d$) evolves with the stellar mass ($M_*$) and redshift as $\\log(M_d) = 1.194\\log(M_*) + 0.0975z - 5.433$; (4) the escape fraction of UV photons ($f_{\\rm esc}^{\\rm UV}$) decreases with increasing mass and star formation rate. At $z \\sim 7$, $f_{\\rm esc}^{\\rm UV} \\sim 0.8~(0.1)$ for $M_* \\sim 10^9~ (10^{11}) \\, M_\\odot$ galaxies; (5) the dust temperature increases with stellar mass, ranging between $30-33$ K for $M_* \\sim 10^{9-11}M_\\odot$ galaxies at $z \\sim 7$. Finally, we predict the far infrared (FIR) LF at $z \\sim 5-20$, testable with ALMA observations, and caution that spectroscopic redshifts and dust masses must be pinned down before invoking unphysical extrema in galaxy formation models.\n",

We compute how this picture is modified at next-to-leading order (NLO) with the goal of assigning a reliable theory uncertainty to the freeze-out predictions. We explicitly compute NLO corrections in a simple model with abelian gauge interactions and provide an estimate of the theoretical uncertainty for the thermal masses of heavy electroweak $n$-plets. Along the way, we clarify the regularization and matching procedure necessary to deal with singular potentials in quantum mechanics with a calculable relativistic UV completion.\n",

As examples, we provide results for two different setups of spin-$1$ BECs that employ a varying magnetic field and spin-orbit coupling, respectively, and also collisions of spin-$1$ solitons in <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>. Our symplectic algorithm is second-order accurate in time, and is extensible to the known higher-order accurate methods.\n",
      "10        We discuss the production of primordial black holes in an early <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> dominated era, which typically takes place in string inspired early universe cosmological models. In particular, we consider a pre-big bang scenario (extending previous results regarding formation in the radiation dominated era) where the enhancement of curvature perturbations is induced by a variation of the sound-speed parameter c_s during the string phase of high-curvature inflation. After imposing all relevant observational constraints, we find that the considered class of models is compatible with the production of a large amount of primordial black holes, in the mass range relevant to <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>, only for a small range of the parameters space. On the other hand, we find that a huge production of light primordial black holes may occur both in such <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> dominated era and in the radiation dominated one.\n",
      "11        We explore an extension of the standard $Λ$CDM model by including an interaction between neutrinos and <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>, and making use of the ground based telescope data of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT). An indication for a non-zero coupling between <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> and neutrinos (both assuming a temperature independent and $T^2$ dependent cross-section) is obtained at the 1$σ$ level coming from the ACT CMB data alone and when combined with the Planck CMB and Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) measurements. This result is confirmed by both fixing the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom in the early Universe to the Standard Model value of $N_{\\rm eff}=3.044$, and allowing $N_{\\rm eff}$ to be a free cosmological parameter. Furthermore, when performing a Bayesian model comparison, the interacting $ν$DM (+$N_{\\rm eff}$) scenario is mostly preferred over a baseline $Λ$CDM (+$N_{\\rm eff}$) cosmology. The preferred value is then used as a benchmark and the potential implications of <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter&#39;s</span> interaction with a sterile neutrino are discussed.\n",
      "12        We present an innovative approach to constraining the non-cold <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> model using a convolutional neural network (CNN). We perform a suite of hydrodynamic simulations with varying <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> particle masses and generate mock 21cm radio intensity maps to trace the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> distribution. Our proposed method complements the traditional power spectrum analysis. We compare our CNN classification results with those from the power spectrum of the differential brightness temperature map of 21cm radiation, and find that the CNN outperforms the latter. Moreover, we investigate the impact of baryonic physics on the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> model constraint, including star formation, self-shielding of HI gas, and UV background model. We find that these effects may introduce some contamination in the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> constraint, but they are insignificant when compared to the realistic system noise of the SKA instruments.\n",
      "13        The <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> power spectrum has been strongly constrained by astronomical measurements at large scales, but only weakly at small scales. Compared with the standard scenario, the deviation of the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> power spectrum at small scales has influence on the cosmological structure formation, e.g., the comoving number density of <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halos. The thermal history of the intergalactic medium (IGM) can be changed if <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> is made of weakly interacting massive particles and can annihilate into standard model particles. The changes of the evolution of IGM could leave imprints on the relevant astronomical observations. Taking into account the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> annihilation, we investigate the impact of the deviation of <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> power spectrum at small scales on the global 21-cm signal. In view of the measurements of the global 21-cm signal by the EDGES experiment, we explore the allowed parameter space of $m_s$, which describes the degree of deviation, by requiring the differential brightness temperature of the global 21-cm signal $δT_{21} \\le -50~\\rm mK$ at redshift $z=17$.\n",
      "14        Using Low Brightness Surface Galaxies (LBSG) rotational curves we inferred the free parameters of $\\ell$-boson stars as a <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> component. The $\\ell$-boson stars are numerical solutions to the non-relativistic limit of the Einstein-Klein-Gordon system, the Schrödinger-Poisson (SP) system. These solutions are parametrized by an angular momentum number $\\ell = (N-1)/2$ and an excitation number $n$. We perform a bayesian analysis by modifying the SimpleMC code to perform the parameter inference, for the cases with $\\ell = 0$, $\\ell = 1$ and multistates of $\\ell$-boson stars. We used the Akaike information criterion (AIC), Bayesian information criterion and the Bayes factor to compare the excited state ($\\ell$=1) and the multistate case with the ground state ($\\ell$=0) as the base model due to its simplicity. We found that the data in most galaxies in the sample favours the multistates case and that the scalar field mass tends to be slightly bigger than the ground state case.\n",
      "15        A long-standing observed curiosity of globular clusters (GCs) has been that both the number and total mass of GCs in a galaxy are linearly correlated with the galaxy&#39;s virial mass, whereas its stellar component shows no such linear correlation. This work expands on an empirical model for the numbers and ages of GCs in galaxies presented by Valenzuela et al. (2021) that is consistent with recent observational data from massive elliptical galaxies down to the dwarf galaxy regime. Applying the model to simulations, GC numbers are shown to be excellent tracers for the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> (DM) virial mass, even when distinct formation mechanisms are employed for blue and red GCs. Furthermore, the amount of DM smooth accretion is encoded in the GC abundances, therefore providing a measure for an otherwise nearly untraceable component of the formation history of galaxies.\n",
      "16        We analytically solve the problem of Bose star growth in the bath of gravitationally interacting particles. We find that after nucleation of this object, the bath is described by a self-similar solution of the kinetic equation, which is an attractor. Together with the conservation laws, this fixes mass evolution of the Bose star. Our results explain slowdown of the star growth at a certain &#34;core-halo&#34; mass, but also predict formation of the heavier and lighter objects in magistral <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> models.\n",
      "17        <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">Dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> subhaloes are key for the predictions of simulations of structure formation, but their existence frequently ends prematurely due to two technical issues, namely numerical disruption in N-body simulations and halo finders failing to identify them. Here we focus on the second issue, using the phase-space friends-of-friends halo finder ROCKSTAR as a benchmark (though we expect our results to translate to comparable codes). We confirm that the most prominent cause for losing track of subhaloes is tidal distortion rather than a low number of particles. As a solution, we present a flexible post-processing algorithm that tracks all subhalo particles over time, computes subhalo positions and masses based on those particles, and progressively removes stripped <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>. If a subhalo is lost by the halo finder, this algorithm keeps tracking its so-called ghost until it has almost no particles left or has truly merged with its host. We apply this technique to a large suite of N-body simulations and restore lost subhaloes to the halo catalogues, which has a dramatic effect on key summary statistics of large-scale structure. Specifically, the subhalo mass function increases by about 50% and the halo correlation function increases by a factor of two at small scales. While these quantitative results are somewhat specific to our algorithm, they demonstrate that particle tracking is a promising way to reliably follow haloes and reduce the need for orphan models. Our algorithm and augmented halo catalogues are publicly available.\n",
      "18        Ultralight bosons are predicted in many extensions to the Standard Model and are popular <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> candidates. The black hole superradiance mechanism allows for these particles to be probed using only their gravitational interaction. In this scenario, an ultralight boson cloud may form spontaneously around a spinning black hole and extract a non-negligible fraction of the black hole&#39;s mass. These oscillating clouds produce quasi-monochromatic, long-duration gravitational waves that may be detectable by ground-based or space-based gravitational wave detectors. We discuss the capability of a new long-duration signal tracking method, based on a hidden Markov model, to detect gravitational wave signals generated by ultralight vector boson clouds, including cases where the signal frequency evolution timescale is much shorter than that of a typical continuous wave signal. We quantify the detection horizon distances for vector boson clouds with current- and next-generation ground-based detectors. We demonstrate that vector clouds hosted by black holes with mass $\\gtrsim 60 M_{\\odot}$ and spin $\\gtrsim 0.6$ are within the reach of current-generation detectors up to a luminosity distance of $\\sim 1$ Gpc. This search method enables one to target vector boson clouds around remnant black holes from compact binary mergers detected by gravitational-wave detectors. We discuss the impact of the sky localization of the merger events and demonstrate that a typical remnant black hole reasonably well-localized by the current generation detector network is accessible in a follow-up search.\n",
      "19        Lithium-drifted silicon [Si(Li)] has been used for decades as an ionizing radiation detector in nuclear, particle, and astrophysical experiments, though such detectors have frequently been limited to small sizes (few cm$^2$) and cryogenic operating temperatures. The 10-cm-diameter Si(Li) detectors developed for the General Antiparticle Spectrometer (GAPS) balloon-borne <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> experiment are novel particularly for their requirements of low cost, large sensitive area (~10 m$^2$ for the full 1440-detector array), high temperatures (near -40$\\,^\\circ$C), and energy resolution below 4 keV FWHM for 20--100-keV x-rays. Previous works have discussed the manufacturing, passivation, and small-scale testing of prototype GAPS Si(Li) detectors. Here we show for the first time the results from detailed characterization of over 1100 flight detectors, illustrating the consistent intrinsic low-noise performance of a large sample of GAPS detectors. This work demonstrates the feasibility of large-area and low-cost Si(Li) detector arrays for next-generation astrophysics and nuclear physics applications.\n",

The boosted <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">Dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">Matter</span> flux at the edge of the Earth&#39;s atmosphere is expected to be pointing to the Galactic Center, with a flux 15 to 20 times larger than in the transverse direction.\n",
      "21        We investigate the reach of future gravitational wave (GW) detectors in probing inflaton couplings with visible sector particles that can either be bosonic or fermionic in nature. Assuming reheating takes place through perturbative quantum production from vacuum in presence of classical inflaton background field, we find that the spectral energy density of the primordial GW generated during inflation becomes sensitive to inflaton-<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> coupling. We conclude, obeying bounds from Big Bang Nucleosysthesis and Cosmic Microwave Background, that, e.g., inflaton-scalar couplings of the order of $\\sim\\mathcal{O}(10^{-20})$ GeV fall within the sensitivity range of several proposed GW detector facilities. However, this prediction is sensitive to the size of the inflationary scale, nature of the inflaton-<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> interaction and shape of the potential during reheating. Having found the time-dependent effective inflaton decay width, we also discuss its implications for <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> (DM) production from the thermal plasma via UV freeze-in during reheating. It is shown, that one can reproduce the observed DM abundance for its mass up to several PeVs, depending on the dimension of the operator connecting DM with the thermal bath and the associated scale of the UV physics. Thus we promote primordial GW to observables sensitive to feebly coupled inflaton, which is very challenging if not impossible to test in conventional particle physics laboratories or astrophysical measurements.\n",
      "22        We argue that demanding a consistent cosmological history, including the absence of domain walls and strongly interacting relics at the Peccei-Quinn scale, singles out two concrete realizations of hadronic QCD axions as viable <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> models. These realizations generally feature flavor-violating axion couplings to Standard Model quarks that are unsuppressed at low energies. As a consequence, experiments looking for flavor-violating hadronic processes involving the axion can be sensitive probes of QCD axion <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> models. In particular, we show that the NA62 and KOTO experiments could detect the $K\\rightarrowπ+ a$ decay for axions consistent with the observed <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> abundance via the post-inflationary misalignment mechanism.\n",
      "23        The mean <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> density within the turnaround radius, which is the boundary that separates a nonexpanding structure from the Hubble flow, was recently proposed as a novel cosmological probe. According to the spherical collapse model, the evolution with cosmic time of this turnaround density, $\\rm ρ_{ta}(z)$, can be used to determine both $\\rm Ω_m$ and $Ω_Λ$, independently of any other currently used probe. The properties of $\\rm ρ_{ta}$ predicted by the spherical collapse model were also shown to persist in the presence of full three-dimensional effects in $\\rm Λ$CDM N-body cosmological simulations when considering galaxy clusters at the present time, $z=0$. However, a small offset was discovered between the spherical-collapse prediction of the value of $ρ_{ta}$ at $z=0$ and its value measured in simulations. In this letter, we explore whether this offset evolves with cosmic time; whether it differs in different cosmologies; whether its origin can be confidently identified; and whether it can be corrected. We found that the offset does evolve slightly with redshift, and that it correlates strongly with the deviation from spherical symmetry of the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halo distribution inside and outside of the turnaround radius. We used an appropriate metric to quantify deviations in the environment of a structure from spherical symmetry. We found that using this metric, we can construct a sphericity-selected sample of halos for which the offset of $ρ_{ta}$ from the spherical collapse prediction is zero, independently of redshift and cosmology. We found that a sphericity-selected halo sample allows us to recover the simulated cosmology, and we conclude that the turnaround density evolution indeed encodes the cosmology in N-body simulations.\n",
      "24        We present a new suite of over 1,500 cosmological N-body simulations with varied Warm <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">Dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">Matter</span> (WDM) models ranging from 2.5 to 30 keV. We use these simulations to train Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to infer WDM particle masses from images of DM field data. Our fiducial setup can make accurate predictions of the WDM particle mass up to 7.5 keV at a 95% confidence level from small maps that cover an area of (25 h$^{-1}$ Mpc)$^2$. We vary the image resolution, simulation resolution, redshift, and cosmology of our fiducial setup to better understand how our model is making predictions. Using these variations, we find that our models are most dependent on simulation resolution, minimally dependent on image resolution, not systematically dependent on redshift, and robust to varied cosmologies. We also find that an important feature to distinguish between WDM models is present with a linear size between 100 and 200 h$^{-1}$ kpc. We compare our fiducial model to one trained on the power spectrum alone and find that our field-level model can make 2x more precise predictions and can make accurate predictions to 2x as massive WDM particle masses when used on the same data. Overall, we find that the field-level data can be used to accurately differentiate between WDM models and contain more information than is captured by the power spectrum. This technique can be extended to more complex DM models and opens up new opportunities to explore alternative DM models in a cosmological environment.\n",
      "25        The properties of globular clusters (GCs) contain valuable information of their host galaxies and <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span>-<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halos. In the remarkable example of ultra-diffuse galaxy, NGC5846-UDG1, the GC population exhibits strong radial mass segregation, indicative of dynamical-friction-driven orbital decay, which opens the possibility of using imaging data alone to constrain the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span>-<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> content of the galaxy. To explore this possibility, we develop a semi-analytical model of GC evolution, which starts from the initial mass function, the initial structure-mass relation, and the initial spatial distribution of the GC progenitors, and follows the effects of dynamical friction, tidal evolution, and two-body relaxation. Using Markov Chain Monte Carlo, we forward-model the GCs in a NGC5846-UDG1-like potential to match the observed GC mass, size, and spatial distributions, and to constrain the profile of the host halo and the origin of the GCs. We find that, with the assumptions of zero mass segregation when the star clusters were born, NGC5846-UDG1 is <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span>-<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> poor compared to what is expected from stellar-to-halo-mass relations, and its halo concentration is low, irrespective of having a cuspy or a cored halo profile. Its GC population has an initial spatial distribution more extended than the smooth stellar distribution. We discuss the results in the context of scaling laws of galaxy-halo connections, and warn against naively using the GC-abundance-halo-mass relation to infer the halo mass of UDGs. Our model is generally applicable to GC-rich dwarf galaxies, and is publicly available at https://github.com/JiangFangzhou/GCevo.\n",
      "26        The Epoch of Reionization (EoR) neutral Hydrogen (HI) 21-cm signal evolves significantly along the line-of-sight (LoS) due to the light-cone (LC) effect. It is important to accurately incorporate this in simulations in order to correctly interpret the signal. 21-cm LC simulations are typically produced by stitching together slices from a finite number $(N_{\\rm RS})$ of &#39;&#39;reionization snapshot&#39;&#39;, each corresponding to a different stage of reionization. In this paper, we have quantified the errors in the 21-cm LC simulation due to the finite value of $N_{\\rm RS}$. We show that this can introduce large discontinuities $(&gt; 200 \\%)$ at the stitching boundaries when $N_{\\rm RS}$ is small $(= 2,4)$ and the mean neutral fraction jumps by $δ\\bar{x}_{\\rm HI} = 0.2,0.1$ respectively at the stitching boundaries. This drops to $17 \\%$ for $N_{\\rm RS} = 13$ where $δ\\bar{x}_{\\rm HI}=0.02$. We present and also validate a method for mitigating this error by increasing $N_{\\rm RS}$ without a proportional increase in the computational costs which are mainly incurred in generating the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> and halo density fields. Our method generates these fields only at a few redshifts, and interpolates them to generate reionization snapshots at closely spaced redshifts. We use this to generate 21-cm LC simulations with $N_{\\rm RS} = 26,51,101$ and $201$, and show that the errors go down as $N_{\\rm RS}^{-1}$.\n",
      "27        The advent of gravitational wave astronomy has seen a huge influx of new predictions for potential discoveries of beyond the Standard Model fields. The coupling of all fundamental fields to gravity, together with its dominance on large scales, makes gravitational physics a rich laboratory to study fundamental physics. This holds especially true for the search for the elusive <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> photon, a promising <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> candidate. The <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> photon is predicted to generate instabilities in a rotating black hole spacetime, birthing a macroscopic Bose-Einstein condensate. These condensates can especially form around super massive black holes, modifying the dynamical inspiralling process. This then opens another window to leverage future space-borne gravitational wave antennas to join the hunt for the elusive <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> particle. This study builds a preliminary model for the gravitational waveform emitted by such a dressed extreme mass-ratio inspiral. Comparing these waveforms to the vacuum scenario allows projections to the potential constrainability on the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> photon mass by space-borne gravitational wave antennas. The superradiant instability of a massive vector field on a Kerr background is calculated and the modification to the dynamics of an inspiralling solar mass-scale compact object is determined with approximations on the backreaction effect of the cloud on the compact object. The end result is the projection that the LISA mission should be able to constrain the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> photon mass using extreme mass ratio inspirals in the range $[1.8 \\times 10^{-17}, 4.47 \\times 10^{-16}]$ eV.\n",
      "28        Recent observations made by the JWST have revealed a number of massive galaxies at high redshift ($z$). The presence of these galaxies appears at odds with the current $Λ$CDM cosmology. Here we investigate the possibility of alleviating the tension by incorporating uncertainties from three sources in counting massive galaxies at high $z$: cosmic variance, error in stellar mass estimate, and contribution by backsplash. We find that each of the sources can significantly increase the cumulative stellar mass density $ρ_*(&gt;M_*)$ at the high-mass end, and the combination of them can boost the density by more than one order of magnitude. Assuming a star formation efficiency of $ε_* \\sim 0.5$, cosmic variance alone can reduce the tension to $2σ$ level, except the most massive galaxy at $z=8$. Including in addition a lognormal dispersion with a width of 0.3 dex in the stellar mass can bring the observed stellar mass density at $z \\sim 7 - 10$ to the $2σ$ range of the cosmic variance. The tension is completely eliminated when gas stripped from backsplash halos is also taken into account. Our results highlight the importance of fully modeling uncertainties when interpreting observational data of rare objects. We use the constrained simulation, ELUCID, to investigate the descendants of high $z$ massive galaxies. We find that a significant portion of these galaxies end up in massive halos with mass $M_{\\rm halo} &gt; 10^{13} h^{-1}M_\\odot $ at $z=0$. A large fraction of central galaxies in $M_{\\rm halo} \\geqslant 10^{14.5} h^{-1}M_\\odot$ halos today are predicted to contain significant amounts of ancient stars formed in massive galaxies at $z\\sim 8$. This prediction can be tested by studying the structure and stellar population of central galaxies in present-day massive clusters.\n",
      "29        Within the $Λ$CDM cosmology, <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> haloes are comprised of both a smooth component and a population of smaller, gravitationally bound subhaloes. These components are often treated as a single halo when halo properties, such as density profiles, are extracted from simulations. Recent work has shown that density profiles change substantially when subhalo mass is excluded. In this paper, we expand on this result by analysing the change in three specific host halo properties -- concentration ($c_{\\rm{NFW}}$), spin ($λ_{\\rm Bullock}$), and shape ($c/a$), -- when calculated only from the smooth component of the halo. This analysis is performed on both Milky Way-mass haloes and cluster-mass haloes in high-resolution, zoom-in, $N$-body simulations. We find that when subhaloes are excluded the median value of (1) $c_{\\rm{NFW}}$ is enhanced by $\\approx 38 \\pm 12\\%$ and $\\approx 88 \\pm 7.7\\%$ for Milky Way mass ($10^{12.1}\\,\\text{M}_\\odot$) and cluster mass ($10^{14.8}\\,\\text{M}_\\odot$) haloes respectively, (2) $λ_{\\rm Bullock}$ is reduced for Milky Way mass by $\\approx 16 \\pm 6.8\\%$ and cluster mass haloes by $\\approx 32 \\pm 8.9\\%$. Additionally, with the removal of subhaloes, cluster mass haloes tend to become more spherical as the ratio of minor-to-major axis, $c/a$, increases by $\\approx 12 \\pm 4\\%$, whereas Milky Way mass haloes remain approximately the same shape with $c/a$ changed by $\\approx 1.2 \\pm 5.6\\%$. The fractional change of each of these properties depends primarily on the amount of mass that is removed from the halo system and, to a lesser extent, mass accretion history. Our findings demonstrate that the properties of the smooth components of <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> haloes are biased relative to the total mass of the halo including subhaloes.\n",
      "30        In order to test active galactic nucleus (AGN) unification and evolutionary models, we measured the AGN clustering properties as a function of AGN obscuration defined in terms of hydrogen column density, $N_{\\rm H}$. In addition to measuring the clustering of unobscured ($N_{\\rm H} &lt; 10^{22}\\,{\\rm cm}^{-2}$) and moderately obscured ($10^{22} \\leq N_{\\rm H} &lt; 10^{23.5}$) AGNs, we also targeted highly obscured sources ($N_{\\rm H}\\geq 10^{23.5}$) up to redshifts of $z=3$. We have compiled one of the largest samples of X-ray-selected AGNs from a total of eight deep XMM/Chandra surveys. We measured the clustering as a function of both AGN obscuration and redshift using the projected two-point correlation function, $w_{\\rm p}(r_{\\rm p})$. We modeled the large-scale clustering signal, measured the AGN bias, $b(z, N_{\\rm H})$, and interpreted it in terms of the typical AGN host <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halo, $M_{\\rm halo}(z, N_{\\rm H}$). We find no significant dependence of AGN clustering on obscuration, suggesting similar typical masses of the hosting halos as a function of $N_{\\rm H}$. This result matches expectations of AGN unification models, in which AGN obscuration depends mainly on the viewing angle of the obscuring torus. We measured, for the first time, the clustering of highly obscured AGNs and find that these objects reside in halos with typical mass $\\log M_{\\rm halo} = 12.98_{-0.22}^{+0.17} [h^{-1} M_\\odot]$ ($12.28_{-0.19}^{+0.13}$) at low $z \\sim 0.7$ (high $z \\sim 1.8$) redshifts. We find that irrespective of obscuration, an increase in AGN bias with redshift is slower than the expectation for a constant halo mass and instead follows the growth rate of halos, known as the passive evolution track. This implies that for those AGNs the clustering is mainly driven by the mass growth rate of the hosting halos and galaxies across cosmic time.\n",
      "31        Mergers between galaxy clusters are an important stage in the formation of the large-scale structure of the Universe. Some of the mergers show a spectacular bow shock that formed as a result of recent passage of a smaller cluster through a bigger one, the classic example of this being the so-called bullet cluster. In this paper, I describe ten examples of interacting clusters identified among 200 of the most massive objects, with total masses above $1.4 \\times 10^{14}$ M$_{\\odot}$, from the IllustrisTNG300 simulation by searching for prominent bow shocks in their temperature maps. Despite different mass ratios of the two merging clusters, the events are remarkably similar in many respects. In all cases, the companion cluster passed close to the main one only once, between 0.9 and 0.3 Gyr ago, with the pericenter distance of 100-530 kpc and a velocity of up to 3400 km s$^{-1}$. The subcluster, typically an order of magnitude smaller in mass than the main cluster before the interaction, loses most of its <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> and gas in the process. The displacement between the collisionless part of the remnant and the bow shock is such that the remnant typically lags behind the shock or coincides with it, with a single exception of the merger occurring with the largest velocity. Usually about 1% of the gas cells in the merging clusters are shocked, and the median Mach numbers of these gas cells are around two. Due to the relatively small size of the simulation box, no close analog of the bullet cluster was found, but I identified one case that is similar in terms of mass, velocity, and displacement. The presented cases bear more resemblance to less extreme observed interacting clusters such as A520 and Coma.\n",
      "32        Microscopic horizonless relics could form in the early universe either directly through gravitational collapse or as stable remnants of the Hawking evaporation of primordial black holes.

We systematically explore the stochastic gravitational-wave background associated with the formation of microscopic <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span>-<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> relics in various scenarios, adopting an agnostic approach and discussing the limitations introduced by existing constraints, possible ways to circumvent the latter, and expected astrophysical foregrounds. Interestingly, this signal is at most marginally detectable with current interferometers but could be detectable by third-generations instruments such as the Einstein Telescope, strengthening their potential as discovery machines.\n",
      "33        In direct <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> (DM) detection via scattering off the electrons, the momentum transfer plays a crucial role. Previous work showed that for self-interacting DM, if the DM particle has a size (the so-called puffy DM), the radius effect could dominate the momentum transfer and become another source of velocity dependence for self-scattering cross section. In this work we investigate the direct detection of puffy DM particles with different radii through electron recoil. We find that comparing with the available experimental exclusion limits dominated by the mediator effect for XENON10, XENON100 and XENON1T, the constraints on the puffy DM-electron scattering cross-section become much weaker for large radius DM particles. For small-radius DM particles, the constraints remain similar to the point-like DM case.\n",
      "34        Boson stars are gravitationally bound objects that arise in ultralight <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> models and form in the centers of galactic halos or axion miniclusters. We systematically study the excitations of a boson star, taking into account the mixing between positive and negative frequencies introduced by gravity. We show that the spectrum contains zero-energy modes in the monopole and dipole sectors resulting from spontaneous symmetry breaking by the boson star background. We analyze the general properties of the eigenmodes and derive their orthogonality and completeness conditions which have non-standard form due to the positive-negative frequency mixing. The eigenvalue problem is solved numerically for the first few energy levels in different multipole sectors and the results are compared to the solutions of the Schrödinger equation in fixed boson star gravitational potential. The two solutions differ significantly for the lowest modes, but get close for higher levels. We further confirm the normal mode spectrum in 3D wave simulations where we inject perturbations with different multipoles. As an application of the normal mode solutions, we compute the matrix element entering the evaporation rate of a boson star immersed in a hot axion gas. The computation combines the use of exact wavefunctions for the low-lying bound states and of the Schrödinger approximation for the high-energy excitations.\n",
      "35        If long-range attractive forces exist and are stronger than gravity then cosmic halo formation can begin in the radiation-dominated era. We study a simple realization of this effect in a system where <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> fermions have Yukawa interactions mediated by scalar particles, analogous to the Higgs boson in the standard model. We develop a self-consistent description of the system including exact background dynamics of the scalar field, and precise modelling of the fermion density fluctuations. For the latter, we provide accurate approximations for the linear growth as well as quantitative modelling of the nonlinear evolution using N-body simulations. We find that halo formation occurs exponentially fast and on scales substantially larger than simple estimates predict. The final fate of these halos remains uncertain, but could be annihilation, <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> stars, primordial black holes, or even the existence of galaxy-sized halos at <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>-radiation equality. More generally, our results demonstrate the importance of mapping scalar-mediated interactions onto structure formation outcomes and constraints for beyond the standard model theories.\n",
      "36        Recent analysis on the stellar kinematics of ultra-faint dwarf (UFD) galaxies has put a stringent upper limit on the self-scattering cross section of <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>, i.e., $σ/m&lt;{\\cal O}(0.1)\\,{\\rm cm^2/g}$ at the scattering velocity of ${\\cal O}(10)\\,{\\rm km/s}$. Resonant self-interacting <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> (rSIDM) is one possibility that can be consistent with the UFDs and explain the low central densities of rotation-supported galaxies; the cross section is resonantly enhanced to be $σ/m = {\\cal O}(1)\\,{\\rm cm^2/g}$ around the scattering velocity of ${\\cal O}(100)\\,{\\rm km/s}$ while being suppressed at lower velocities. To further assess this possibility, since the inferred <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> distribution of halos from astrophysical observations is usually compared to that in constant-cross section SIDM (cSIDM), whether the structures of rSIDM halos can be approximated by the cSIDM halo profiles needs to be clarified. In this work, we employ the grovothermal fluid method to investigate the structural evolution of rSIDM halos in a wide mass range. We find that except for halos in a specific mass range, the present structures of rSIDM halos are virtually indistinguishable from those of the cSIDM halos. For halos in the specific mass range, the resonant self-scattering renders a break in their density profile. We demonstrate how such a density-profile break appears in astrophysical observations, e.g., rotation curves and line-of-sight velocity dispersion profiles. We show that for halos above the specific mass range, the density-profile break thermalizes to disappear before the present. We demonstrate that such distinctive thermalization dynamics can leave imprints on the orbital classes of stars with similar ages and metallicities.\n",
      "37        The E-type $α$-attractor models of single-field inflation were generalized further in order to accommodate production of primordial black holes (PBH) via adding a near-inflection point to the inflaton scalar potential at smaller scales, in good agreement with measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation. A minimal number of new parameters was used but their fine-tuning was maximized in order to increase possible masses of PBH formed during an ultra-slow-roll phase leading to a large enhancement of the power spectrum of scalar (curvature) perturbations by 6 or 7 orders of magnitude against the power spectrum of perturbations observed in CMB. It was found that extreme fine-tuning of the parameters in our models can lead to a formation of the Earth-size PBH with the masses of approximately $10^{27}$ g, still in agreement with CMB observations. Quantum corrections are known to lead to the perturbative upper bound on the amplitude of large scalar perturbations responsible for PBH production. The quantum (one-loop) corrections in our models were found to be suppressed by one order of magnitude for PBH with the masses of approximately $10^{19}$ g, which may form the whole <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> in the Universe.\n",
      "38        We discuss in detail the possibility that the &#34;type-II majoron&#34; -- that is, the pseudo Nambu-Goldstone boson that arises in the context of the type-II seesaw mechanism if the lepton number is spontaneously broken by an additional singlet scalar -- account for the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> (DM) observed in the universe. We study the requirements the model&#39;s parameters have to fulfill in order to reproduce the measured DM relic abundance through two possible production mechanisms in the early universe, freeze-in and misalignment, both during a standard radiation-dominated era and early <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> domination. We then study possible signals of type-II majoron DM and the present and expected constraints on the parameter space that can be obtained from cosmological observations, direct detection experiments, and present and future searches for decaying DM at neutrino telescopes and cosmic-ray experiments. We find that -- depending on the majoron mass, the production mechanism, and the value of the vacuum expectation value of the type-II triplet -- all of the three decay modes (photons, electrons, neutrinos) of majoron DM particles can yield observable signals at future indirect searches for DM. Furthermore, in a corner of the parameter space, detection of majoron DM is possible through electron recoil at running and future direct detection experiments.\n",
      "39        Running vacuum models and viscous <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> scenarios beyond perfect fluid idealization are two appealing theoretical strategies that have been separately studied as alternatives to solve some problems rooted in the $Λ$CDM cosmological model. In this paper, we combine these two notions in a single cosmological setting and investigate their cosmological implications, paying particular attention in the interplay between these two constituents in different cosmological periods. Specifically, we consider a well-studied running vacuum model inspired by renormalization group, and a recently proposed general parameterization for the bulk viscosity $ξ$. By employing dynamical system analysis, we explore the physical aspects of the new phase space that emerges from the combined models and derive stability conditions that ensure complete cosmological dynamics. We identify four distinct classes of models and find that the critical points of the phase space are non-trivially renewed compared to the single scenarios. We then proceed, in a joint and complementary way to the dynamical system analysis, with a detailed numerical exploration to quantify the impact of both the running parameter and the bulk viscosity coefficient on the cosmological evolution. Thus, for some values of the model parameters, numerical solutions show qualitative differences from the $Λ$CDM model, which is phenomenologically appealing in light of cosmological observations.\n",
      "40        The intrinsic alignment (IA) of observed galaxy shapes with the underlying cosmic web is a source of contamination in weak lensing surveys. Sensitive methods to identify the IA signal will therefore need to be included in the upcoming weak lensing analysis pipelines. Hydrodynamical cosmological simulations allow us to directly measure the intrinsic ellipticities of galaxies and thus provide a powerful approach to predict and understand the IA signal. Here we employ the novel, large-volume hydrodynamical simulation MTNG740, a product of the MillenniumTNG (MTNG) project, to study the IA of galaxies. We measure the projected correlation functions between the intrinsic shape/shear of galaxies and various tracers of large-scale structure, $w_{+g},\\ w_{+m},\\ w_{++}$ over the radial range $r_{\\rm p} \\in [0.02 , 200]\\,h^{-1}{\\rm Mpc}$ and at redshifts $z=0.0$, $0.5$ and $1.0$. We detect significant signal-to-noise IA signals with the density field for both elliptical and spiral galaxies. We also find significant intrinsic shear-shear correlations for ellipticals. We further examine correlations of the intrinsic shape of galaxies with the local tidal field. Here we find a significant IA signal for elliptical galaxies assuming a linear model. We also detect a weak IA signal for spiral galaxies under a quadratic tidal torquing model. Lastly, we measure the alignment between central galaxies and their host <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span>-<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halos, finding small to moderate misalignments between their principal axes that decline with halo mass.\n",
      "41        We study weak gravitational lensing convergence maps produced from the MillenniumTNG (MTNG) simulations by direct projection of the mass distribution on the past backwards lightcone of a fiducial observer. We explore the lensing maps over a large dynamic range in simulation mass and angular resolution, allowing us to establish a clear assessment of numerical convergence. By comparing full physics hydrodynamical simulations with corresponding <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span>-<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>-only runs we quantify the impact of baryonic physics on the most important weak lensing statistics. Likewise, we predict the impact of massive neutrinos reliably far into the non-linear regime. We also demonstrate that the &#34;fixed &amp; paired&#34; variance suppression technique increases the statistical robustness of the simulation predictions on large scales not only for time slices but also for continuously output lightcone data. We find that both baryonic and neutrino effects substantially impact weak lensing shear measurements, with the latter dominating over the former on large angular scales. Thus, both effects must explicitly be included to obtain sufficiently accurate predictions for stage IV lensing surveys. Reassuringly, our results agree accurately with other simulation results where available, supporting the promise of simulation modelling for precision cosmology far into the non-linear regime.\n",
      "42        An era of kination occurs when the Universe&#39;s energy density is dominated by a fast-rolling scalar field. <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">Dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> that is thermally produced during an era of kination requires larger-than-canonical annihilation cross sections to generate the observed <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> relic abundance. Furthermore, <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> density perturbations that enter the horizon during an era of kination grow linearly with the scale factor prior to radiation domination. We show how the resulting enhancement to the small-scale <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> power spectrum increases the microhalo abundance and boosts the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> annihilation rate. We then use gamma-ray observations to constrain thermal <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> production during kination. The annihilation boost factor depends on the minimum halo mass, which is determined by the small-scale cutoff in the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> power spectrum. Therefore, observational limits on the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> annihilation rate imply a minimum cutoff scale for a given <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> particle mass and kination scenario. For <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> that was once in thermal equilibrium with the Standard Model, this constraint establishes a maximum allowed kinetic decoupling temperature for the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>. This bound on the decoupling temperature implies that the growth of perturbations during kination cannot appreciably boost the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> annihilation rate if <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> was once in thermal equilibrium with the Standard Model.\n",
      "43        We present the measurement of total and stellar/<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> decomposed mass density profile around a sample of galaxy groups and clusters with dynamical masses derived from integral-field stellar kinematics from the MaNGA survey in Paper~I and weak lensing derived from the DECaLS imaging survey. Combining the two data sets enables accurate measurement of the radial density distribution from several kpc to Mpc scales. Intriguingly, we find that the excess surface density derived from stellar kinematics in the inner region cannot be explained by simply adding an NFW <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halo extrapolated from lensing measurement at a larger scale to a stellar mass component derived from the NASA-Sloan Atlas (NSA) catalog. We find that a good fit to both data sets requires a stellar mass normalization about 3 times higher than that derived from the NSA catalog, which would require an unrealistically too-heavy initial mass function for stellar mass estimation. If we keep the stellar mass normalization to that of the NSA catalog but allow a varying inner <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> density profile, we obtain an asymptotic slope of $γ_{\\rm gnfw}$= $1.82_{-0.25}^{+0.15}$, $γ_{\\rm gnfw}$= $1.48_{-0.41}^{+0.20}$ for the group bin and the cluster bin respectively, significantly steeper than the NFW case. We also compare the total mass inner density slopes with those from Illustris-TNG300 and find that the values from the simulation are lower than the observation by at least $3σ$ level.\n",
      "44        We present dynamical scaling relations, combined with the stellar population properties, for a subsample of about 6000 nearby galaxies with the most reliable dynamical models extracted from the full MaNGA sample of 10K galaxies. We show that the inclination-corrected mass plane (MP) for both early-type galaxies (ETGs) and late-type galaxies (LTGs), which links dynamical mass, projected half-light radius $R_{\\rm e}$, and the second stellar velocity moment $σ_{\\rm e}$ within $R_{\\rm e}$, satisfies the virial theorem and is even tighter than the uncorrected one. We find a clear parabolic relation between $\\lg(M/L)(&lt;R_{\\rm e})$, the total mass-to-light ratio within a sphere of radius $R_{\\rm e}$, and $\\lgσ_{\\rm e}$, with the $M/L$ increasing with $σ_{\\rm e}$ and for older stellar populations. However, the relation for ETGs is linear and the one for the youngest galaxies is constant. We confirm and improve the relation between average logarithmic total density slopes $γ_{_{\\rm T}}$ and $σ_{\\rm e}$: $γ_{_{\\rm T}}$ become steeper with increasing $σ_{\\rm e}$ until $\\lg(σ_{\\rm e}/{\\rm km\\,s^{-1}})\\approx 2.2$ and then remain constant around $γ_{_{\\rm T}}\\approx -2.2$. The $γ_{_{\\rm T}}-σ_{\\rm e}$ variation is larger for LTGs than ETGs. At fixed $σ_{\\rm e}$ the total density profiles steepen with galaxy age and for ETGs. We find generally low <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> fractions, median $f_{\\rm DM}(&lt;R_{\\rm e})=8$ per cent, within a sphere of radius $R_{\\rm e}$. However, we find that $f_{\\rm DM}(&lt;R_{\\rm e})$ depends on $σ_{\\rm e}$ better than stellar mass: <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> increases to a median $f_{\\rm DM}=33$ percent for galaxies with $σ_{\\rm e}\\lesssim100{\\rm km\\,s^{-1}}$. The increased $f_{\\rm DM}(&lt;R_{\\rm e})$ at low $σ_{\\rm e}$ explains the parabolic $\\lg(M/L)(&lt;R_{\\rm e})-\\lgσ_{\\rm e}$ relation.\n",
      "45        We analyze the global stellar population, radial gradients and non-parametric star formation history of $\\sim 10$K galaxies from the MaNGA Survey final data release 17 (DR17), based on stellar population synthesis and full-spectrum fitting, and relate them with dynamical properties of galaxies. We confirm that stellar population correlates with stellar velocity dispersion $σ_{\\rm e}$ better than with stellar mass $M_{\\ast}$, but also find that younger galaxies are more metal-poor at fixed $σ_{\\rm e}$. Stellar age, metallicity, and mass-to-light ratio $M_{\\ast}/L$ all decrease with galaxy rotation, while radial gradients become more negative (i.e., younger, more metal-poor, and lower $M_{\\ast}/L$ in the outskirts). The trend between metallicity gradients and rotation reverses for slow rotators, which stand out for their more negative metallicity gradients than faster-rotating galaxies. We highlight a population of massive disk galaxies on the green valley, on the $(σ_{\\rm e},\\rm Age)$ plane, that show steep negative age and metallicity gradients, consistent with their old central bulges surrounded by young star-forming disks and metal-poor gas accretion. Galaxies with high $σ_{\\rm e}$, steep total mass-density slope, low <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> fraction, high $M_{\\ast}/L$, and high metallicity have the highest star-formation rate at earlier times, and are currently quenched.

      "46        This is the first paper in our series on the combined analysis of the Dynamics and stellar Population (DynPop) for the MaNGA survey in the final SDSS Data Release 17 (DR17). Here we present a catalogue of dynamically-determined quantities for over 10000 nearby galaxies based on integral-field stellar kinematics from the MaNGA survey. The dynamical properties are extracted using the axisymmetric Jeans Anisotropic Modelling (JAM) method, which was previously shown to be the most accurate for this kind of study. We assess systematic uncertainties using eight dynamical models with different assumptions. We use two orientations of the velocity ellipsoid: either cylindrically-aligned JAM$_{\\rm cyl}$ or spherically-aligned JAM$_{\\rm sph}$. We also make four assumptions for the models&#39; <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> vs. luminous <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> distributions: (1) mass-follows-light, (2) free NFW <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> halo, (3) cosmologically-constrained NFW halo, (4) generalized NFW <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> halo, i.e. with free inner slope. In this catalogue, we provide the quantities related to the mass distributions (e.g. the density slopes and enclosed mass within a sphere of a given radius for total mass, stellar mass, and <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> mass components). We also provide the complete models which can be used to compute the full luminous and mass distribution of each galaxy. Additionally, we visually assess the qualities of the models to help with model selections. We estimate the observed scatter in the measured quantities which decreases as expected with improvements in quality. For the best data quality, we find a remarkable consistency of measured quantities between different models, highlighting the robustness of the results.\n",
      "47        What is the highest energy at which gravitons can be observed? We address this question by studying graviton-to-photon conversion - the inverse-Gertsenshtein effect - in the magnetic field of the Milky Way. We find that above $\\sim 1~\\mbox{PeV}$ the effective photon mass grows large enough to quench the conversion rate. The induced photon flux is comparable to the sensitivity of LHAASO to a diffuse $γ$-ray background, but only for graviton abundances of order $Ω_{\\text{gw}} h^2_0 \\sim 1$. In the future, owing to a better understanding of $γ$-ray backgrounds, larger effective areas and longer observation times, sub-PeV shimmering gravitons with a realistic abundance of $Ω_{\\text{gw}} h^2_0 \\sim 0.01$ could be detected. We show that this is achieved in a cosmologically-motivated scenario of post-recombination superheavy <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> decay. Therefore, the sub-PeV range might be the ultimate energy frontier at which gravitons can be observed.\n",
      "48        The relation between the total mass contained in the globular clusters of a galaxy and the mass of its <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halo has been found observationally to be nearly linear over five decades of mass. However, the high-mass end of this relation is not well determined from previous data and shows large scatter. We analyze the globular cluster systems (GCSs) of a homogeneous sample of 11 brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) through DOLPHOT photometry of their deep Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images in the F814W filter. We standardize the definition of $M_{GCS}$, the total GCS mass, by using the GC total population within a limiting radius of $0.1 R_{virial}$, while the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span>-<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halo mass $M_h$ is determined from the weak-lensing calibration of $M_h$ versus $M_{bary}$. When these 11 BCGs are added to the previously studied homogeneous catalogue of Virgo member galaxies, a total value for $η= M_{GCS}/M_h$ is found to be $(3.0\\pm1.8_{internal})\\times10^{-5}$, slightly higher than previous estimates but with much reduced uncertainty. Perhaps more importantly, the results suggest that the relation continues to have a near-linear shape at the highest galaxy masses, strongly reinforcing the conclusion that accreted GCs make a major contribution to the GC populations at high galaxy mass.\n",
      "49        We introduce an analytic surface density profile for <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halos that accurately reproduces the structure of simulated halos of mass $M_{\\rm vir} = 10^{7-11}\\ M_\\odot$, making it useful for modeling line-of-sight perturbers in strong gravitational lensing models. The two-parameter function has an analytic deflection potential and is more accurate than the projected Navarro, Frenk &amp; White (NFW) profile commonly adopted at this mass scale for perturbers, especially at the small radii of most relevant for lensing perturbations. Using a characteristic radius, $R_{-1}$, where the log slope of surface density is equal to $-1$, and an associated surface density, $Σ_{-1}$, we can represent the expected lensing signal from line-of-sight halos statistically, for an ensemble of halo orientations, using a distribution of {\\em projected concentration} parameters, $\\mathcal{C}_{\\rm vir} := r_{\\rm vir}/ R_{-1}$. Though an individual halo can have a projected concentration that varies with orientation with respect to the observer, the range of projected concentrations correlates with the usual three-dimensional halo concentration in a way that enables ease of use.\n",

We search for Lyman-break dropout-selected galaxies using HST WFC3/ACS broadband imaging in the fields of three $6 &lt; z &lt; 7$ quasars, as well as their simultaneously observed coordinated-parallel fields, and constrain their photometric redshifts using EAZY. One field, J0305-3150, shows a volume density 10$\\times$ higher than the blank-field UV luminosity function (UVLF) at M$_{UV} &lt; -20$, with tentative evidence of a 3$σ$ overdensity in its parallel field located 15 cMpc away. Another field, J2054-0005, shows an angular overdensity within 500 ckpc from the quasar but still consistent with UVLF predictions within 3$σ$, while the last field, J2348-3054, shows no enhancement. We discuss methods for reducing uncertainty in overdensity measurements when using photometric selection and show that we can robustly select LBGs consistent with being physically associated with the quasar, corroborated by existing JWST/NIRCam WFSS data in the J0305 field. Even accounting for incompleteness, the overdensities in J0305 and J2054 are higher for brighter galaxies at short angular separations, suggesting preferential enhancement of more massive galaxies in the immediate vicinity of the quasar. Finally, we compare the LBG population with previously-identified [CII] and mm-continuum companions; the LBG overdensities are not accompanied by an enhanced number of dusty galaxies, suggesting that the overdense quasar fields are not in the bursty star-forming phase sometimes seen in high-redshift protoclusters.\n"

The effects of DM on NS properties, including the mass-radius relation, the moment of inertia, and tidal deformability, are calculated by varying its fraction. The study found that the EOS becomes softer with increasing DM momentum, and the DM has marginal effects on nuclear <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> properties, except for the EOSs and binding energy per particle. The study also calculated the properties of isolated, static, and rotating DM admixed NS and found that the DM has significant effects on both static and rotating NS. We have also observed that a tiny amount of DM can accumulate inside the NS, and more amount of it makes the NS unstable. The study also suggests that the secondary component might be a NS with DM content if the underlying nuclear EOS is sufficiently stiff. The $f$-mode oscillations of the DM admixed hyperon stars are calculated and found that there exist a correlation between canonical $f$-mode frequency and the dimensionless tidal deformability parameter ($Λ_{1.4}$) and we have put a constraint on $f$-mode frequency using GW170817 data. Finally, we have calculated the DM admixed binary NS properties and found that the binary system becomes less deformed and sustains more time in its inspiral phases with the addition of DM. Therefore, we suggest that one can take DM inside the compact objects while modeling the inspiral waveforms for the BNS systems.\n",

Ideal targets must have large ratio of DM to baryonic <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>. However, such ``<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span>&#39;&#39; systems have a poorly known level of magnetic turbulence, which determines the residence time of the electrons and positrons and therefore also the strength of the expected signal. This typically leads to significant uncertainties in the derived DM bounds. In a novel approach, we compute the self-confinement of the DM-induced electrons and positrons. Indeed, they themselves generate irregularities in the magnetic field, thus setting a lower limit on the presence of the magnetic turbulence. We specifically apply this approach to dwarf spheroidal galaxies. Finally, by comparing the expected synchrotron emission with radio data from the direction of the Draco galaxy collected at the Giant Metre Radio Telescope, we show that the proposed approach can be used to set robust and competitive bounds on WIMP DM.\n",
      "4        The particle origin of <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> (DM) is still one of the main puzzles in modern physics. One of the most promising search strategy to detect DM at laboratories is through the indirect search of cosmic particles that are produced from DM annihilation in space. In particular, the flux of cosmic positrons has been measured with high precision by the AMS-02 experiment demonstrating that an excess above 10 GeV, with respect to the secondary production, is present. We study in this paper the possible DM origin of the positron excess finding the values of the DM mass $M$ and annihilation cross section $\\langle σv \\rangle$ that are needed to fit high-energy positron data. In particular, we find that for DM annihilating into $b\\bar{b}$ it is required to have $M=43$ TeV and $\\langle σv \\rangle = 10^{-21}$ cm$^3$/s while for $τ^+τ^-$ $M=2$ TeV and $\\langle σv \\rangle = 3\\times 10^{-23}$ cm$^3$/s. If DM produce positrons, they are expected to generate gamma rays from the center of the Milky Way and around dwarf galaxy satellites of the Galaxy. We thus combine the values for the DM mass and annihilation cross section obtained with the fit to AMS-02 positron data with the upper limits derived with the non-detection of $γ$ rays with HESS in the direction of the Galactic center and Fermi-LAT for the combined analysis of dwarf galaxies. The main result of the paper is that only DM annihilating into $μ^+ μ^-$ with a mass around 500 GeV and $\\langle σv \\rangle = 4\\times 10^{-24}$ cm$^3$/s can fit AMS-02 data and be compatible with the upper limits found with $γ$ rays. As for the $τ^+ τ^-$ ($b\\bar{b}$) channel, DM can contribute at most at a few tens $\\%$ (a few \\%) level.\n",

      "6        Numerous observations suggest that there exist undiscovered beyond-the-Standard-Model particles and fields. Because of their unknown nature, these exotic particles and fields could interact with Standard Model particles in many different ways and assume a variety of possible configurations. Here we present an overview of the Global Network of Optical Magnetometers for Exotic physics searches (GNOME), our ongoing experimental program designed to test a wide range of exotic physics scenarios. The GNOME experiment utilizes a worldwide network of shielded atomic magnetometers (and, more recently, comagnetometers) to search for spatially and temporally correlated signals due to torques on atomic spins from exotic fields of astrophysical origin. We survey the temporal characteristics of a variety of possible signals currently under investigation such as those from topological defect <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> (axion-like particle domain walls), axion-like particle stars, solitons of complex-valued scalar fields (Q-balls), stochastic fluctuations of bosonic <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> fields, a solar axion-like particle halo, and bursts of ultralight bosonic fields produced by cataclysmic astrophysical events such as binary black hole mergers.\n",
      "7        Recent observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) are yielding tantalizing hints of an early population of massive, bright galaxies at $z &gt; 10$, with Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) observations indicating significant dust masses in place as early as $z\\sim 7$. To understand the implications of these observations, we use the DELPHI semi-analytic model that jointly tracks the assembly of <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halos and their constituent baryons, including the key processes of dust enrichment. Our model employs only two redshift- and mass-independent free parameters that are tuned against all available galaxy data at $z \\sim 5-9$ before it is used to make predictions up to $z \\sim 20$. Our key results are: (1) the model progressively under-predicts the observed ultraviolet luminosity function (UV LF) at $z &gt; 12$; observations at $z&gt;16$ lie close to, or even above, a &#34;maximal&#34; model where all available gas is turned into stars; (2) UV selection would miss 34% of the star formation rate density at $z \\sim 5$, decreasing to 17% by $z \\sim 10$ for bright galaxies with $\\rm{M_{UV}} &lt; -19$; (3) the dust mass ($M_d$) evolves with the stellar mass ($M_*$) and redshift as $\\log(M_d) = 1.194\\log(M_*) + 0.0975z - 5.433$; (4) the escape fraction of UV photons ($f_{\\rm esc}^{\\rm UV}$) decreases with increasing mass and star formation rate. At $z \\sim 7$, $f_{\\rm esc}^{\\rm UV} \\sim 0.8~(0.1)$ for $M_* \\sim 10^9~ (10^{11}) \\, M_\\odot$ galaxies; (5) the dust temperature increases with stellar mass, ranging between $30-33$ K for $M_* \\sim 10^{9-11}M_\\odot$ galaxies at $z \\sim 7$. Finally, we predict the far infrared (FIR) LF at $z \\sim 5-20$, testable with ALMA observations, and caution that spectroscopic redshifts and dust masses must be pinned down before invoking unphysical extrema in galaxy formation models.\n",
      "8        We reexamine the consequences of perturbative unitarity on <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> freeze-out when both Sommerfeld enhancement and bound state formation affect <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> annihilations. At leading order (LO) the annihilation cross-section is infrared dominated and the connection between the unitarity bound and the upper bound on the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> mass depends only on how the different partial waves are populated. We compute how this picture is modified at next-to-leading order (NLO) with the goal of assigning a reliable theory uncertainty to the freeze-out predictions. We explicitly compute NLO corrections in a simple model with abelian gauge interactions and provide an estimate of the theoretical uncertainty for the thermal masses of heavy electroweak $n$-plets. Along the way, we clarify the regularization and matching procedure necessary to deal with singular potentials in quantum mechanics with a calculable relativistic UV completion.\n",
      "9        We provide an algorithm for evolving general spin-$s$ Gross-Pitaevskii / non-linear Schrödinger systems carrying a variety of interactions, where the $2s+1$ components of the `spinor&#39; field represent the different spin-multiplicity states. We consider many nonrelativistic interactions up to quartic order in the Schrödinger field (both short and long-range, and spin-dependent and spin-independent interactions), including explicit spin-orbit couplings. The algorithm allows for spatially varying external and/or self-generated vector potentials that couple to the spin density of the field. Our work can be used for scenarios ranging from laboratory systems such as spinor Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs), to cosmological/astrophysical systems such as self-interacting bosonic <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>. As examples, we provide results for two different setups of spin-$1$ BECs that employ a varying magnetic field and spin-orbit coupling, respectively, and also collisions of spin-$1$ solitons in <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>.

      "10        We discuss the production of primordial black holes in an early <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> dominated era, which typically takes place in string inspired early universe cosmological models. In particular, we consider a pre-big bang scenario (extending previous results regarding formation in the radiation dominated era) where the enhancement of curvature perturbations is induced by a variation of the sound-speed parameter c_s during the string phase of high-curvature inflation. After imposing all relevant observational constraints, we find that the considered class of models is compatible with the production of a large amount of primordial black holes, in the mass range relevant to <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>, only for a small range of the parameters space. On the other hand, we find that a huge production of light primordial black holes may occur both in such <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> dominated era and in the radiation dominated one.\n",

An indication for a non-zero coupling between <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> and neutrinos (both assuming a temperature independent and $T^2$ dependent cross-section) is obtained at the 1$σ$ level coming from the ACT CMB data alone and when combined with the Planck CMB and Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) measurements. This result is confirmed by both fixing the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom in the early Universe to the Standard Model value of $N_{\\rm eff}=3.044$, and allowing $N_{\\rm eff}$ to be a free cosmological parameter. Furthermore, when performing a Bayesian model comparison, the interacting $ν$DM (+$N_{\\rm eff}$) scenario is mostly preferred over a baseline $Λ$CDM (+$N_{\\rm eff}$) cosmology. The preferred value is then used as a benchmark and the potential implications of <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter&#39;s</span> interaction with a sterile neutrino are discussed.\n",

Our proposed method complements the traditional power spectrum analysis. We compare our CNN classification results with those from the power spectrum of the differential brightness temperature map of 21cm radiation, and find that the CNN outperforms the latter. Moreover, we investigate the impact of baryonic physics on the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> model constraint, including star formation, self-shielding of HI gas, and UV background model.

      "13        The <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> power spectrum has been strongly constrained by astronomical measurements at large scales, but only weakly at small scales. Compared with the standard scenario, the deviation of the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> power spectrum at small scales has influence on the cosmological structure formation, e.g., the comoving number density of <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halos. The thermal history of the intergalactic medium (IGM) can be changed if <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> is made of weakly interacting massive particles and can annihilate into standard model particles.

In view of the measurements of the global 21-cm signal by the EDGES experiment, we explore the allowed parameter space of $m_s$, which describes the degree of deviation, by requiring the differential brightness temperature of the global 21-cm signal $δT_{21} \\le -50~\\rm mK$ at redshift $z=17$.\n",

The $\\ell$-boson stars are numerical solutions to the non-relativistic limit of the Einstein-Klein-Gordon system, the Schrödinger-Poisson (SP) system. These solutions are parametrized by an angular momentum number $\\ell = (N-1)/2$ and an excitation number $n$. We perform a bayesian analysis by modifying the SimpleMC code to perform the parameter inference, for the cases with $\\ell = 0$, $\\ell = 1$ and multistates of $\\ell$-boson stars. We used the Akaike information criterion (AIC), Bayesian information criterion and the Bayes factor to compare the excited state ($\\ell$=1) and the multistate case with the ground state ($\\ell$=0) as the base model due to its simplicity. We found that the data in most galaxies in the sample favours the multistates case and that the scalar field mass tends to be slightly bigger than the ground state case.\n",
      "15        A long-standing observed curiosity of globular clusters (GCs) has been that both the number and total mass of GCs in a galaxy are linearly correlated with the galaxy&#39;s virial mass, whereas its stellar component shows no such linear correlation. This work expands on an empirical model for the numbers and ages of GCs in galaxies presented by Valenzuela et al. (2021) that is consistent with recent observational data from massive elliptical galaxies down to the dwarf galaxy regime. Applying the model to simulations, GC numbers are shown to be excellent tracers for the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> (DM) virial mass, even when distinct formation mechanisms are employed for blue and red GCs. Furthermore, the amount of DM smooth accretion is encoded in the GC abundances, therefore providing a measure for an otherwise nearly untraceable component of the formation history of galaxies.\n",
      "16        We analytically solve the problem of Bose star growth in the bath of gravitationally interacting particles. We find that after nucleation of this object, the bath is described by a self-similar solution of the kinetic equation, which is an attractor. Together with the conservation laws, this fixes mass evolution of the Bose star. Our results explain slowdown of the star growth at a certain &#34;core-halo&#34; mass, but also predict formation of the heavier and lighter objects in magistral <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> models.\n",
      "17        <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">Dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> subhaloes are key for the predictions of simulations of structure formation, but their existence frequently ends prematurely due to two technical issues, namely numerical disruption in N-body simulations and halo finders failing to identify them. Here we focus on the second issue, using the phase-space friends-of-friends halo finder ROCKSTAR as a benchmark (though we expect our results to translate to comparable codes). We confirm that the most prominent cause for losing track of subhaloes is tidal distortion rather than a low number of particles. As a solution, we present a flexible post-processing algorithm that tracks all subhalo particles over time, computes subhalo positions and masses based on those particles, and progressively removes stripped <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>. If a subhalo is lost by the halo finder, this algorithm keeps tracking its so-called ghost until it has almost no particles left or has truly merged with its host. We apply this technique to a large suite of N-body simulations and restore lost subhaloes to the halo catalogues, which has a dramatic effect on key summary statistics of large-scale structure. Specifically, the subhalo mass function increases by about 50% and the halo correlation function increases by a factor of two at small scales. While these quantitative results are somewhat specific to our algorithm, they demonstrate that particle tracking is a promising way to reliably follow haloes and reduce the need for orphan models. Our algorithm and augmented halo catalogues are publicly available.\n",
      "18        Ultralight bosons are predicted in many extensions to the Standard Model and are popular <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> candidates. The black hole superradiance mechanism allows for these particles to be probed using only their gravitational interaction. In this scenario, an ultralight boson cloud may form spontaneously around a spinning black hole and extract a non-negligible fraction of the black hole&#39;s mass. These oscillating clouds produce quasi-monochromatic, long-duration gravitational waves that may be detectable by ground-based or space-based gravitational wave detectors. We discuss the capability of a new long-duration signal tracking method, based on a hidden Markov model, to detect gravitational wave signals generated by ultralight vector boson clouds, including cases where the signal frequency evolution timescale is much shorter than that of a typical continuous wave signal. We quantify the detection horizon distances for vector boson clouds with current- and next-generation ground-based detectors. We demonstrate that vector clouds hosted by black holes with mass $\\gtrsim 60 M_{\\odot}$ and spin $\\gtrsim 0.6$ are within the reach of current-generation detectors up to a luminosity distance of $\\sim 1$ Gpc. This search method enables one to target vector boson clouds around remnant black holes from compact binary mergers detected by gravitational-wave detectors. We discuss the impact of the sky localization of the merger events and demonstrate that a typical remnant black hole reasonably well-localized by the current generation detector network is accessible in a follow-up search.\n",
      "19        Lithium-drifted silicon [Si(Li)] has been used for decades as an ionizing radiation detector in nuclear, particle, and astrophysical experiments, though such detectors have frequently been limited to small sizes (few cm$^2$) and cryogenic operating temperatures. The 10-cm-diameter Si(Li) detectors developed for the General Antiparticle Spectrometer (GAPS) balloon-borne <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> experiment are novel particularly for their requirements of low cost, large sensitive area (~10 m$^2$ for the full 1440-detector array), high temperatures (near -40$\\,^\\circ$C), and energy resolution below 4 keV FWHM for 20--100-keV x-rays. Previous works have discussed the manufacturing, passivation, and small-scale testing of prototype GAPS Si(Li) detectors. Here we show for the first time the results from detailed characterization of over 1100 flight detectors, illustrating the consistent intrinsic low-noise performance of a large sample of GAPS detectors.

      "21        We investigate the reach of future gravitational wave (GW) detectors in probing inflaton couplings with visible sector particles that can either be bosonic or fermionic in nature. Assuming reheating takes place through perturbative quantum production from vacuum in presence of classical inflaton background field, we find that the spectral energy density of the primordial GW generated during inflation becomes sensitive to inflaton-<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> coupling. We conclude, obeying bounds from Big Bang Nucleosysthesis and Cosmic Microwave Background, that, e.g., inflaton-scalar couplings of the order of $\\sim\\mathcal{O}(10^{-20})$ GeV fall within the sensitivity range of several proposed GW detector facilities. However, this prediction is sensitive to the size of the inflationary scale, nature of the inflaton-<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> interaction and shape of the potential during reheating. Having found the time-dependent effective inflaton decay width, we also discuss its implications for <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> (DM) production from the thermal plasma via UV freeze-in during reheating. It is shown, that one can reproduce the observed DM abundance for its mass up to several PeVs, depending on the dimension of the operator connecting DM with the thermal bath and the associated scale of the UV physics. Thus we promote primordial GW to observables sensitive to feebly coupled inflaton, which is very challenging if not impossible to test in conventional particle physics laboratories or astrophysical measurements.\n",
      "22        We argue that demanding a consistent cosmological history, including the absence of domain walls and strongly interacting relics at the Peccei-Quinn scale, singles out two concrete realizations of hadronic QCD axions as viable <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> models. These realizations generally feature flavor-violating axion couplings to Standard Model quarks that are unsuppressed at low energies. As a consequence, experiments looking for flavor-violating hadronic processes involving the axion can be sensitive probes of QCD axion <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> models. In particular, we show that the NA62 and KOTO experiments could detect the $K\\rightarrowπ+ a$ decay for axions consistent with the observed <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> abundance via the post-inflationary misalignment mechanism.\n",
      "23        The mean <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> density within the turnaround radius, which is the boundary that separates a nonexpanding structure from the Hubble flow, was recently proposed as a novel cosmological probe. According to the spherical collapse model, the evolution with cosmic time of this turnaround density, $\\rm ρ_{ta}(z)$, can be used to determine both $\\rm Ω_m$ and $Ω_Λ$, independently of any other currently used probe. The properties of $\\rm ρ_{ta}$ predicted by the spherical collapse model were also shown to persist in the presence of full three-dimensional effects in $\\rm Λ$CDM N-body cosmological simulations when considering galaxy clusters at the present time, $z=0$. However, a small offset was discovered between the spherical-collapse prediction of the value of $ρ_{ta}$ at $z=0$ and its value measured in simulations. In this letter, we explore whether this offset evolves with cosmic time; whether it differs in different cosmologies; whether its origin can be confidently identified; and whether it can be corrected. We found that the offset does evolve slightly with redshift, and that it correlates strongly with the deviation from spherical symmetry of the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halo distribution inside and outside of the turnaround radius. We used an appropriate metric to quantify deviations in the environment of a structure from spherical symmetry. We found that using this metric, we can construct a sphericity-selected sample of halos for which the offset of $ρ_{ta}$ from the spherical collapse prediction is zero, independently of redshift and cosmology. We found that a sphericity-selected halo sample allows us to recover the simulated cosmology, and we conclude that the turnaround density evolution indeed encodes the cosmology in N-body simulations.\n",
      "24        We present a new suite of over 1,500 cosmological N-body simulations with varied Warm <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">Dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">Matter</span> (WDM) models ranging from 2.5 to 30 keV. We use these simulations to train Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to infer WDM particle masses from images of DM field data. Our fiducial setup can make accurate predictions of the WDM particle mass up to 7.5 keV at a 95% confidence level from small maps that cover an area of (25 h$^{-1}$ Mpc)$^2$. We vary the image resolution, simulation resolution, redshift, and cosmology of our fiducial setup to better understand how our model is making predictions. Using these variations, we find that our models are most dependent on simulation resolution, minimally dependent on image resolution, not systematically dependent on redshift, and robust to varied cosmologies. We also find that an important feature to distinguish between WDM models is present with a linear size between 100 and 200 h$^{-1}$ kpc. We compare our fiducial model to one trained on the power spectrum alone and find that our field-level model can make 2x more precise predictions and can make accurate predictions to 2x as massive WDM particle masses when used on the same data. Overall, we find that the field-level data can be used to accurately differentiate between WDM models and contain more information than is captured by the power spectrum. This technique can be extended to more complex DM models and opens up new opportunities to explore alternative DM models in a cosmological environment.\n",
      "25        The properties of globular clusters (GCs) contain valuable information of their host galaxies and <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span>-<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halos. In the remarkable example of ultra-diffuse galaxy, NGC5846-UDG1, the GC population exhibits strong radial mass segregation, indicative of dynamical-friction-driven orbital decay, which opens the possibility of using imaging data alone to constrain the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span>-<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> content of the galaxy. To explore this possibility, we develop a semi-analytical model of GC evolution, which starts from the initial mass function, the initial structure-mass relation, and the initial spatial distribution of the GC progenitors, and follows the effects of dynamical friction, tidal evolution, and two-body relaxation. Using Markov Chain Monte Carlo, we forward-model the GCs in a NGC5846-UDG1-like potential to match the observed GC mass, size, and spatial distributions, and to constrain the profile of the host halo and the origin of the GCs. We find that, with the assumptions of zero mass segregation when the star clusters were born, NGC5846-UDG1 is <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span>-<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> poor compared to what is expected from stellar-to-halo-mass relations, and its halo concentration is low, irrespective of having a cuspy or a cored halo profile. Its GC population has an initial spatial distribution more extended than the smooth stellar distribution. We discuss the results in the context of scaling laws of galaxy-halo connections, and warn against naively using the GC-abundance-halo-mass relation to infer the halo mass of UDGs. Our model is generally applicable to GC-rich dwarf galaxies, and is publicly available at https://github.com/JiangFangzhou/GCevo.\n",

It is important to accurately incorporate this in simulations in order to correctly interpret the signal. 21-cm LC simulations are typically produced by stitching together slices from a finite number $(N_{\\rm RS})$ of &#39;&#39;reionization snapshot&#39;&#39;, each corresponding to a different stage of reionization. In this paper, we have quantified the errors in the 21-cm LC simulation due to the finite value of $N_{\\rm RS}$. We show that this can introduce large discontinuities $(&gt; 200 \\%)$ at the stitching boundaries when $N_{\\rm RS}$ is small $(= 2,4)$ and the mean neutral fraction jumps by $δ\\bar{x}_{\\rm HI} = 0.2,0.1$ respectively at the stitching boundaries. This drops to $17 \\%$ for $N_{\\rm RS} = 13$ where $δ\\bar{x}_{\\rm HI}=0.02$. We present and also validate a method for mitigating this error by increasing $N_{\\rm RS}$ without a proportional increase in the computational costs which are mainly incurred in generating the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> and halo density fields. Our method generates these fields only at a few redshifts, and interpolates them to generate reionization snapshots at closely spaced redshifts. We use this to generate 21-cm LC simulations with $N_{\\rm RS} = 26,51,101$ and $201$, and show that the errors go down as $N_{\\rm RS}^{-1}$.\n",
      "27        The advent of gravitational wave astronomy has seen a huge influx of new predictions for potential discoveries of beyond the Standard Model fields. The coupling of all fundamental fields to gravity, together with its dominance on large scales, makes gravitational physics a rich laboratory to study fundamental physics. This holds especially true for the search for the elusive <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> photon, a promising <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> candidate. The <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> photon is predicted to generate instabilities in a rotating black hole spacetime, birthing a macroscopic Bose-Einstein condensate. These condensates can especially form around super massive black holes, modifying the dynamical inspiralling process. This then opens another window to leverage future space-borne gravitational wave antennas to join the hunt for the elusive <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> particle. This study builds a preliminary model for the gravitational waveform emitted by such a dressed extreme mass-ratio inspiral. Comparing these waveforms to the vacuum scenario allows projections to the potential constrainability on the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> photon mass by space-borne gravitational wave antennas. The superradiant instability of a massive vector field on a Kerr background is calculated and the modification to the dynamics of an inspiralling solar mass-scale compact object is determined with approximations on the backreaction effect of the cloud on the compact object. The end result is the projection that the LISA mission should be able to constrain the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> photon mass using extreme mass ratio inspirals in the range $[1.8 \\times 10^{-17}, 4.47 \\times 10^{-16}]$ eV.\n",
      "28        Recent observations made by the JWST have revealed a number of massive galaxies at high redshift ($z$). The presence of these galaxies appears at odds with the current $Λ$CDM cosmology. Here we investigate the possibility of alleviating the tension by incorporating uncertainties from three sources in counting massive galaxies at high $z$: cosmic variance, error in stellar mass estimate, and contribution by backsplash. We find that each of the sources can significantly increase the cumulative stellar mass density $ρ_*(&gt;M_*)$ at the high-mass end, and the combination of them can boost the density by more than one order of magnitude. Assuming a star formation efficiency of $ε_* \\sim 0.5$, cosmic variance alone can reduce the tension to $2σ$ level, except the most massive galaxy at $z=8$. Including in addition a lognormal dispersion with a width of 0.3 dex in the stellar mass can bring the observed stellar mass density at $z \\sim 7 - 10$ to the $2σ$ range of the cosmic variance. The tension is completely eliminated when gas stripped from backsplash halos is also taken into account. Our results highlight the importance of fully modeling uncertainties when interpreting observational data of rare objects. We use the constrained simulation, ELUCID, to investigate the descendants of high $z$ massive galaxies. We find that a significant portion of these galaxies end up in massive halos with mass $M_{\\rm halo} &gt; 10^{13} h^{-1}M_\\odot $ at $z=0$. A large fraction of central galaxies in $M_{\\rm halo} \\geqslant 10^{14.5} h^{-1}M_\\odot$ halos today are predicted to contain significant amounts of ancient stars formed in massive galaxies at $z\\sim 8$. This prediction can be tested by studying the structure and stellar population of central galaxies in present-day massive clusters.\n",
      "29        Within the $Λ$CDM cosmology, <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> haloes are comprised of both a smooth component and a population of smaller, gravitationally bound subhaloes. These components are often treated as a single halo when halo properties, such as density profiles, are extracted from simulations. Recent work has shown that density profiles change substantially when subhalo mass is excluded. In this paper, we expand on this result by analysing the change in three specific host halo properties -- concentration ($c_{\\rm{NFW}}$), spin ($λ_{\\rm Bullock}$), and shape ($c/a$), -- when calculated only from the smooth component of the halo. This analysis is performed on both Milky Way-mass haloes and cluster-mass haloes in high-resolution, zoom-in, $N$-body simulations. We find that when subhaloes are excluded the median value of (1) $c_{\\rm{NFW}}$ is enhanced by $\\approx 38 \\pm 12\\%$ and $\\approx 88 \\pm 7.7\\%$ for Milky Way mass ($10^{12.1}\\,\\text{M}_\\odot$) and cluster mass ($10^{14.8}\\,\\text{M}_\\odot$) haloes respectively, (2) $λ_{\\rm Bullock}$ is reduced for Milky Way mass by $\\approx 16 \\pm 6.8\\%$ and cluster mass haloes by $\\approx 32 \\pm 8.9\\%$. Additionally, with the removal of subhaloes, cluster mass haloes tend to become more spherical as the ratio of minor-to-major axis, $c/a$, increases by $\\approx 12 \\pm 4\\%$, whereas Milky Way mass haloes remain approximately the same shape with $c/a$ changed by $\\approx 1.2 \\pm 5.6\\%$. The fractional change of each of these properties depends primarily on the amount of mass that is removed from the halo system and, to a lesser extent, mass accretion history. Our findings demonstrate that the properties of the smooth components of <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> haloes are biased relative to the total mass of the halo including subhaloes.\n",
      "30        In order to test active galactic nucleus (AGN) unification and evolutionary models, we measured the AGN clustering properties as a function of AGN obscuration defined in terms of hydrogen column density, $N_{\\rm H}$. In addition to measuring the clustering of unobscured ($N_{\\rm H} &lt; 10^{22}\\,{\\rm cm}^{-2}$) and moderately obscured ($10^{22} \\leq N_{\\rm H} &lt; 10^{23.5}$) AGNs, we also targeted highly obscured sources ($N_{\\rm H}\\geq 10^{23.5}$) up to redshifts of $z=3$. We have compiled one of the largest samples of X-ray-selected AGNs from a total of eight deep XMM/Chandra surveys. We measured the clustering as a function of both AGN obscuration and redshift using the projected two-point correlation function, $w_{\\rm p}(r_{\\rm p})$. We modeled the large-scale clustering signal, measured the AGN bias, $b(z, N_{\\rm H})$, and interpreted it in terms of the typical AGN host <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halo, $M_{\\rm halo}(z, N_{\\rm H}$). We find no significant dependence of AGN clustering on obscuration, suggesting similar typical masses of the hosting halos as a function of $N_{\\rm H}$. This result matches expectations of AGN unification models, in which AGN obscuration depends mainly on the viewing angle of the obscuring torus. We measured, for the first time, the clustering of highly obscured AGNs and find that these objects reside in halos with typical mass $\\log M_{\\rm halo} = 12.98_{-0.22}^{+0.17} [h^{-1} M_\\odot]$ ($12.28_{-0.19}^{+0.13}$) at low $z \\sim 0.7$ (high $z \\sim 1.8$) redshifts. We find that irrespective of obscuration, an increase in AGN bias with redshift is slower than the expectation for a constant halo mass and instead follows the growth rate of halos, known as the passive evolution track. This implies that for those AGNs the clustering is mainly driven by the mass growth rate of the hosting halos and galaxies across cosmic time.\n",
      "31        Mergers between galaxy clusters are an important stage in the formation of the large-scale structure of the Universe. Some of the mergers show a spectacular bow shock that formed as a result of recent passage of a smaller cluster through a bigger one, the classic example of this being the so-called bullet cluster. In this paper, I describe ten examples of interacting clusters identified among 200 of the most massive objects, with total masses above $1.4 \\times 10^{14}$ M$_{\\odot}$, from the IllustrisTNG300 simulation by searching for prominent bow shocks in their temperature maps. Despite different mass ratios of the two merging clusters, the events are remarkably similar in many respects. In all cases, the companion cluster passed close to the main one only once, between 0.9 and 0.3 Gyr ago, with the pericenter distance of 100-530 kpc and a velocity of up to 3400 km s$^{-1}$. The subcluster, typically an order of magnitude smaller in mass than the main cluster before the interaction, loses most of its <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> and gas in the process. The displacement between the collisionless part of the remnant and the bow shock is such that the remnant typically lags behind the shock or coincides with it, with a single exception of the merger occurring with the largest velocity. Usually about 1% of the gas cells in the merging clusters are shocked, and the median Mach numbers of these gas cells are around two. Due to the relatively small size of the simulation box, no close analog of the bullet cluster was found, but I identified one case that is similar in terms of mass, velocity, and displacement. The presented cases bear more resemblance to less extreme observed interacting clusters such as A520 and Coma.\n",
      "32        Microscopic horizonless relics could form in the early universe either directly through gravitational collapse or as stable remnants of the Hawking evaporation of primordial black holes. In both cases they completely or partially evade cosmological constraints arising from Hawking evaporation and in certain mass ranges can explain the entirety of the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>. We systematically explore the stochastic gravitational-wave background associated with the formation of microscopic <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span>-<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> relics in various scenarios, adopting an agnostic approach and discussing the limitations introduced by existing constraints, possible ways to circumvent the latter, and expected astrophysical foregrounds. Interestingly, this signal is at most marginally detectable with current interferometers but could be detectable by third-generations instruments such as the Einstein Telescope, strengthening their potential as discovery machines.\n",
      "33        In direct <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> (DM) detection via scattering off the electrons, the momentum transfer plays a crucial role. Previous work showed that for self-interacting DM, if the DM particle has a size (the so-called puffy DM), the radius effect could dominate the momentum transfer and become another source of velocity dependence for self-scattering cross section. In this work we investigate the direct detection of puffy DM particles with different radii through electron recoil. We find that comparing with the available experimental exclusion limits dominated by the mediator effect for XENON10, XENON100 and XENON1T, the constraints on the puffy DM-electron scattering cross-section become much weaker for large radius DM particles. For small-radius DM particles, the constraints remain similar to the point-like DM case.\n",
      "34        Boson stars are gravitationally bound objects that arise in ultralight <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> models and form in the centers of galactic halos or axion miniclusters. We systematically study the excitations of a boson star, taking into account the mixing between positive and negative frequencies introduced by gravity. We show that the spectrum contains zero-energy modes in the monopole and dipole sectors resulting from spontaneous symmetry breaking by the boson star background. We analyze the general properties of the eigenmodes and derive their orthogonality and completeness conditions which have non-standard form due to the positive-negative frequency mixing. The eigenvalue problem is solved numerically for the first few energy levels in different multipole sectors and the results are compared to the solutions of the Schrödinger equation in fixed boson star gravitational potential. The two solutions differ significantly for the lowest modes, but get close for higher levels. We further confirm the normal mode spectrum in 3D wave simulations where we inject perturbations with different multipoles. As an application of the normal mode solutions, we compute the matrix element entering the evaporation rate of a boson star immersed in a hot axion gas. The computation combines the use of exact wavefunctions for the low-lying bound states and of the Schrödinger approximation for the high-energy excitations.\n",
      "35        If long-range attractive forces exist and are stronger than gravity then cosmic halo formation can begin in the radiation-dominated era. We study a simple realization of this effect in a system where <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> fermions have Yukawa interactions mediated by scalar particles, analogous to the Higgs boson in the standard model. We develop a self-consistent description of the system including exact background dynamics of the scalar field, and precise modelling of the fermion density fluctuations. For the latter, we provide accurate approximations for the linear growth as well as quantitative modelling of the nonlinear evolution using N-body simulations. We find that halo formation occurs exponentially fast and on scales substantially larger than simple estimates predict. The final fate of these halos remains uncertain, but could be annihilation, <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> stars, primordial black holes, or even the existence of galaxy-sized halos at <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>-radiation equality. More generally, our results demonstrate the importance of mapping scalar-mediated interactions onto structure formation outcomes and constraints for beyond the standard model theories.\n",
      "36        Recent analysis on the stellar kinematics of ultra-faint dwarf (UFD) galaxies has put a stringent upper limit on the self-scattering cross section of <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>, i.e., $σ/m&lt;{\\cal O}(0.1)\\,{\\rm cm^2/g}$ at the scattering velocity of ${\\cal O}(10)\\,{\\rm km/s}$. Resonant self-interacting <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> (rSIDM) is one possibility that can be consistent with the UFDs and explain the low central densities of rotation-supported galaxies; the cross section is resonantly enhanced to be $σ/m = {\\cal O}(1)\\,{\\rm cm^2/g}$ around the scattering velocity of ${\\cal O}(100)\\,{\\rm km/s}$ while being suppressed at lower velocities. To further assess this possibility, since the inferred <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> distribution of halos from astrophysical observations is usually compared to that in constant-cross section SIDM (cSIDM), whether the structures of rSIDM halos can be approximated by the cSIDM halo profiles needs to be clarified. In this work, we employ the grovothermal fluid method to investigate the structural evolution of rSIDM halos in a wide mass range. We find that except for halos in a specific mass range, the present structures of rSIDM halos are virtually indistinguishable from those of the cSIDM halos. For halos in the specific mass range, the resonant self-scattering renders a break in their density profile. We demonstrate how such a density-profile break appears in astrophysical observations, e.g., rotation curves and line-of-sight velocity dispersion profiles. We show that for halos above the specific mass range, the density-profile break thermalizes to disappear before the present. We demonstrate that such distinctive thermalization dynamics can leave imprints on the orbital classes of stars with similar ages and metallicities.\n",
      "37        The E-type $α$-attractor models of single-field inflation were generalized further in order to accommodate production of primordial black holes (PBH) via adding a near-inflection point to the inflaton scalar potential at smaller scales, in good agreement with measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation. A minimal number of new parameters was used but their fine-tuning was maximized in order to increase possible masses of PBH formed during an ultra-slow-roll phase leading to a large enhancement of the power spectrum of scalar (curvature) perturbations by 6 or 7 orders of magnitude against the power spectrum of perturbations observed in CMB. It was found that extreme fine-tuning of the parameters in our models can lead to a formation of the Earth-size PBH with the masses of approximately $10^{27}$ g, still in agreement with CMB observations. Quantum corrections are known to lead to the perturbative upper bound on the amplitude of large scalar perturbations responsible for PBH production. The quantum (one-loop) corrections in our models were found to be suppressed by one order of magnitude for PBH with the masses of approximately $10^{19}$ g, which may form the whole <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> in the Universe.\n",
      "38        We discuss in detail the possibility that the &#34;type-II majoron&#34; -- that is, the pseudo Nambu-Goldstone boson that arises in the context of the type-II seesaw mechanism if the lepton number is spontaneously broken by an additional singlet scalar -- account for the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> (DM) observed in the universe. We study the requirements the model&#39;s parameters have to fulfill in order to reproduce the measured DM relic abundance through two possible production mechanisms in the early universe, freeze-in and misalignment, both during a standard radiation-dominated era and early <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> domination. We then study possible signals of type-II majoron DM and the present and expected constraints on the parameter space that can be obtained from cosmological observations, direct detection experiments, and present and future searches for decaying DM at neutrino telescopes and cosmic-ray experiments. We find that -- depending on the majoron mass, the production mechanism, and the value of the vacuum expectation value of the type-II triplet -- all of the three decay modes (photons, electrons, neutrinos) of majoron DM particles can yield observable signals at future indirect searches for DM. Furthermore, in a corner of the parameter space, detection of majoron DM is possible through electron recoil at running and future direct detection experiments.\n",
      "39        Running vacuum models and viscous <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> scenarios beyond perfect fluid idealization are two appealing theoretical strategies that have been separately studied as alternatives to solve some problems rooted in the $Λ$CDM cosmological model. In this paper, we combine these two notions in a single cosmological setting and investigate their cosmological implications, paying particular attention in the interplay between these two constituents in different cosmological periods. Specifically, we consider a well-studied running vacuum model inspired by renormalization group, and a recently proposed general parameterization for the bulk viscosity $ξ$. By employing dynamical system analysis, we explore the physical aspects of the new phase space that emerges from the combined models and derive stability conditions that ensure complete cosmological dynamics. We identify four distinct classes of models and find that the critical points of the phase space are non-trivially renewed compared to the single scenarios. We then proceed, in a joint and complementary way to the dynamical system analysis, with a detailed numerical exploration to quantify the impact of both the running parameter and the bulk viscosity coefficient on the cosmological evolution. Thus, for some values of the model parameters, numerical solutions show qualitative differences from the $Λ$CDM model, which is phenomenologically appealing in light of cosmological observations.\n",
      "40        The intrinsic alignment (IA) of observed galaxy shapes with the underlying cosmic web is a source of contamination in weak lensing surveys. Sensitive methods to identify the IA signal will therefore need to be included in the upcoming weak lensing analysis pipelines. Hydrodynamical cosmological simulations allow us to directly measure the intrinsic ellipticities of galaxies and thus provide a powerful approach to predict and understand the IA signal. Here we employ the novel, large-volume hydrodynamical simulation MTNG740, a product of the MillenniumTNG (MTNG) project, to study the IA of galaxies. We measure the projected correlation functions between the intrinsic shape/shear of galaxies and various tracers of large-scale structure, $w_{+g},\\ w_{+m},\\ w_{++}$ over the radial range $r_{\\rm p} \\in [0.02 , 200]\\,h^{-1}{\\rm Mpc}$ and at redshifts $z=0.0$, $0.5$ and $1.0$. We detect significant signal-to-noise IA signals with the density field for both elliptical and spiral galaxies. We also find significant intrinsic shear-shear correlations for ellipticals. We further examine correlations of the intrinsic shape of galaxies with the local tidal field. Here we find a significant IA signal for elliptical galaxies assuming a linear model. We also detect a weak IA signal for spiral galaxies under a quadratic tidal torquing model. Lastly, we measure the alignment between central galaxies and their host <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span>-<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halos, finding small to moderate misalignments between their principal axes that decline with halo mass.\n",
      "41        We study weak gravitational lensing convergence maps produced from the MillenniumTNG (MTNG) simulations by direct projection of the mass distribution on the past backwards lightcone of a fiducial observer. We explore the lensing maps over a large dynamic range in simulation mass and angular resolution, allowing us to establish a clear assessment of numerical convergence. By comparing full physics hydrodynamical simulations with corresponding <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span>-<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>-only runs we quantify the impact of baryonic physics on the most important weak lensing statistics. Likewise, we predict the impact of massive neutrinos reliably far into the non-linear regime. We also demonstrate that the &#34;fixed &amp; paired&#34; variance suppression technique increases the statistical robustness of the simulation predictions on large scales not only for time slices but also for continuously output lightcone data. We find that both baryonic and neutrino effects substantially impact weak lensing shear measurements, with the latter dominating over the former on large angular scales. Thus, both effects must explicitly be included to obtain sufficiently accurate predictions for stage IV lensing surveys. Reassuringly, our results agree accurately with other simulation results where available, supporting the promise of simulation modelling for precision cosmology far into the non-linear regime.\n",
      "42        An era of kination occurs when the Universe&#39;s energy density is dominated by a fast-rolling scalar field. <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">Dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> that is thermally produced during an era of kination requires larger-than-canonical annihilation cross sections to generate the observed <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> relic abundance. Furthermore, <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> density perturbations that enter the horizon during an era of kination grow linearly with the scale factor prior to radiation domination. We show how the resulting enhancement to the small-scale <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> power spectrum increases the microhalo abundance and boosts the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> annihilation rate. We then use gamma-ray observations to constrain thermal <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> production during kination. The annihilation boost factor depends on the minimum halo mass, which is determined by the small-scale cutoff in the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> power spectrum. Therefore, observational limits on the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> annihilation rate imply a minimum cutoff scale for a given <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> particle mass and kination scenario. For <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> that was once in thermal equilibrium with the Standard Model, this constraint establishes a maximum allowed kinetic decoupling temperature for the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>.

      "43        We present the measurement of total and stellar/<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> decomposed mass density profile around a sample of galaxy groups and clusters with dynamical masses derived from integral-field stellar kinematics from the MaNGA survey in Paper~I and weak lensing derived from the DECaLS imaging survey. Combining the two data sets enables accurate measurement of the radial density distribution from several kpc to Mpc scales. Intriguingly, we find that the excess surface density derived from stellar kinematics in the inner region cannot be explained by simply adding an NFW <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halo extrapolated from lensing measurement at a larger scale to a stellar mass component derived from the NASA-Sloan Atlas (NSA) catalog. We find that a good fit to both data sets requires a stellar mass normalization about 3 times higher than that derived from the NSA catalog, which would require an unrealistically too-heavy initial mass function for stellar mass estimation. If we keep the stellar mass normalization to that of the NSA catalog but allow a varying inner <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> density profile, we obtain an asymptotic slope of $γ_{\\rm gnfw}$= $1.82_{-0.25}^{+0.15}$, $γ_{\\rm gnfw}$= $1.48_{-0.41}^{+0.20}$ for the group bin and the cluster bin respectively, significantly steeper than the NFW case. We also compare the total mass inner density slopes with those from Illustris-TNG300 and find that the values from the simulation are lower than the observation by at least $3σ$ level.\n",
      "44        We present dynamical scaling relations, combined with the stellar population properties, for a subsample of about 6000 nearby galaxies with the most reliable dynamical models extracted from the full MaNGA sample of 10K galaxies. We show that the inclination-corrected mass plane (MP) for both early-type galaxies (ETGs) and late-type galaxies (LTGs), which links dynamical mass, projected half-light radius $R_{\\rm e}$, and the second stellar velocity moment $σ_{\\rm e}$ within $R_{\\rm e}$, satisfies the virial theorem and is even tighter than the uncorrected one. We find a clear parabolic relation between $\\lg(M/L)(&lt;R_{\\rm e})$, the total mass-to-light ratio within a sphere of radius $R_{\\rm e}$, and $\\lgσ_{\\rm e}$, with the $M/L$ increasing with $σ_{\\rm e}$ and for older stellar populations. However, the relation for ETGs is linear and the one for the youngest galaxies is constant. We confirm and improve the relation between average logarithmic total density slopes $γ_{_{\\rm T}}$ and $σ_{\\rm e}$: $γ_{_{\\rm T}}$ become steeper with increasing $σ_{\\rm e}$ until $\\lg(σ_{\\rm e}/{\\rm km\\,s^{-1}})\\approx 2.2$ and then remain constant around $γ_{_{\\rm T}}\\approx -2.2$. The $γ_{_{\\rm T}}-σ_{\\rm e}$ variation is larger for LTGs than ETGs. At fixed $σ_{\\rm e}$ the total density profiles steepen with galaxy age and for ETGs. We find generally low <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> fractions, median $f_{\\rm DM}(&lt;R_{\\rm e})=8$ per cent, within a sphere of radius $R_{\\rm e}$.

      "45        We analyze the global stellar population, radial gradients and non-parametric star formation history of $\\sim 10$K galaxies from the MaNGA Survey final data release 17 (DR17), based on stellar population synthesis and full-spectrum fitting, and relate them with dynamical properties of galaxies. We confirm that stellar population correlates with stellar velocity dispersion $σ_{\\rm e}$ better than with stellar mass $M_{\\ast}$, but also find that younger galaxies are more metal-poor at fixed $σ_{\\rm e}$. Stellar age, metallicity, and mass-to-light ratio $M_{\\ast}/L$ all decrease with galaxy rotation, while radial gradients become more negative (i.e., younger, more metal-poor, and lower $M_{\\ast}/L$ in the outskirts). The trend between metallicity gradients and rotation reverses for slow rotators, which stand out for their more negative metallicity gradients than faster-rotating galaxies. We highlight a population of massive disk galaxies on the green valley, on the $(σ_{\\rm e},\\rm Age)$ plane, that show steep negative age and metallicity gradients, consistent with their old central bulges surrounded by young star-forming disks and metal-poor gas accretion.

      "46        This is the first paper in our series on the combined analysis of the Dynamics and stellar Population (DynPop) for the MaNGA survey in the final SDSS Data Release 17 (DR17). Here we present a catalogue of dynamically-determined quantities for over 10000 nearby galaxies based on integral-field stellar kinematics from the MaNGA survey. The dynamical properties are extracted using the axisymmetric Jeans Anisotropic Modelling (JAM) method, which was previously shown to be the most accurate for this kind of study. We assess systematic uncertainties using eight dynamical models with different assumptions. We use two orientations of the velocity ellipsoid: either cylindrically-aligned JAM$_{\\rm cyl}$ or spherically-aligned JAM$_{\\rm sph}$. We also make four assumptions for the models&#39; <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> vs. luminous <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> distributions: (1) mass-follows-light, (2) free NFW <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> halo, (3) cosmologically-constrained NFW halo, (4) generalized NFW <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> halo, i.e. with free inner slope. In this catalogue, we provide the quantities related to the mass distributions (e.g. the density slopes and enclosed mass within a sphere of a given radius for total mass, stellar mass, and <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> mass components). We also provide the complete models which can be used to compute the full luminous and mass distribution of each galaxy. Additionally, we visually assess the qualities of the models to help with model selections. We estimate the observed scatter in the measured quantities which decreases as expected with improvements in quality. For the best data quality, we find a remarkable consistency of measured quantities between different models, highlighting the robustness of the results.\n",
      "47        What is the highest energy at which gravitons can be observed? We address this question by studying graviton-to-photon conversion - the inverse-Gertsenshtein effect - in the magnetic field of the Milky Way. We find that above $\\sim 1~\\mbox{PeV}$ the effective photon mass grows large enough to quench the conversion rate. The induced photon flux is comparable to the sensitivity of LHAASO to a diffuse $γ$-ray background, but only for graviton abundances of order $Ω_{\\text{gw}} h^2_0 \\sim 1$. In the future, owing to a better understanding of $γ$-ray backgrounds, larger effective areas and longer observation times, sub-PeV shimmering gravitons with a realistic abundance of $Ω_{\\text{gw}} h^2_0 \\sim 0.01$ could be detected. We show that this is achieved in a cosmologically-motivated scenario of post-recombination superheavy <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> decay. Therefore, the sub-PeV range might be the ultimate energy frontier at which gravitons can be observed.\n",
      "48        The relation between the total mass contained in the globular clusters of a galaxy and the mass of its <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halo has been found observationally to be nearly linear over five decades of mass. However, the high-mass end of this relation is not well determined from previous data and shows large scatter. We analyze the globular cluster systems (GCSs) of a homogeneous sample of 11 brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) through DOLPHOT photometry of their deep Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images in the F814W filter. We standardize the definition of $M_{GCS}$, the total GCS mass, by using the GC total population within a limiting radius of $0.1 R_{virial}$, while the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span>-<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halo mass $M_h$ is determined from the weak-lensing calibration of $M_h$ versus $M_{bary}$. When these 11 BCGs are added to the previously studied homogeneous catalogue of Virgo member galaxies, a total value for $η= M_{GCS}/M_h$ is found to be $(3.0\\pm1.8_{internal})\\times10^{-5}$, slightly higher than previous estimates but with much reduced uncertainty. Perhaps more importantly, the results suggest that the relation continues to have a near-linear shape at the highest galaxy masses, strongly reinforcing the conclusion that accreted GCs make a major contribution to the GC populations at high galaxy mass.\n",
      "49        We introduce an analytic surface density profile for <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halos that accurately reproduces the structure of simulated halos of mass $M_{\\rm vir} = 10^{7-11}\\ M_\\odot$, making it useful for modeling line-of-sight perturbers in strong gravitational lensing models. The two-parameter function has an analytic deflection potential and is more accurate than the projected Navarro, Frenk &amp; White (NFW) profile commonly adopted at this mass scale for perturbers, especially at the small radii of most relevant for lensing perturbations. Using a characteristic radius, $R_{-1}$, where the log slope of surface density is equal to $-1$, and an associated surface density, $Σ_{-1}$, we can represent the expected lensing signal from line-of-sight halos statistically, for an ensemble of halo orientations, using a distribution of {\\em projected concentration} parameters, $\\mathcal{C}_{\\rm vir} := r_{\\rm vir}/ R_{-1}$. Though an individual halo can have a projected concentration that varies with orientation with respect to the observer, the range of projected concentrations correlates with the usual three-dimensional halo concentration in a way that enables ease of use.\n",
      "50        Axions and axion-like particles (ALPs) are a prominent <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> candidate, drawing motivation in part from the axiverse of string theory. Axion-like particles can also arise as composite degrees of freedom of a <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> sector, for example, as <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> pions in <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> Quantum Chromo-Dynamics. In a <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> Standard Model (SM) wherein all 6 quark flavors are light while the photon is massive, one finds a rich low-energy spectrum of stable and ultralight particles, in the form of neutral and charged <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> scalars, and complex neutral scalars analogous to the SM kaon, with mass splittings determined by the mass and charge of the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> quarks. The model finds a natural portal to the visible sector via kinetic coupling of the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> and visible photons, and consequent millicharges for <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>. The <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> can be a mixture of all these ultralight bosonic degrees of freedom, and exhibit both parity-even and parity-odd interactions, making the theory testable at a wide variety of experiments. In context of <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> QCD with $N_f$ flavors of light quarks, this scenario predicts $N_f^2-1$ ultralight axion-like particles -- effectively an axiverse from <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> QCD. This &#39;$π$-axiverse&#39; is consistent with but makes no recourse to string theory, and is complementary to the conventional string theory axiverse.\n",
      "51        The most luminous quasars at $z &gt; 6$ are suspected to be both highly clustered and reside in the most massive <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halos in the early Universe, making them prime targets to search for galaxy overdensities and/or protoclusters. We search for Lyman-break dropout-selected galaxies using HST WFC3/ACS broadband imaging in the fields of three $6 &lt; z &lt; 7$ quasars, as well as their simultaneously observed coordinated-parallel fields, and constrain their photometric redshifts using EAZY. One field, J0305-3150, shows a volume density 10$\\times$ higher than the blank-field UV luminosity function (UVLF) at M$_{UV} &lt; -20$, with tentative evidence of a 3$σ$ overdensity in its parallel field located 15 cMpc away. Another field, J2054-0005, shows an angular overdensity within 500 ckpc from the quasar but still consistent with UVLF predictions within 3$σ$, while the last field, J2348-3054, shows no enhancement. We discuss methods for reducing uncertainty in overdensity measurements when using photometric selection and show that we can robustly select LBGs consistent with being physically associated with the quasar, corroborated by existing JWST/NIRCam WFSS data in the J0305 field. Even accounting for incompleteness, the overdensities in J0305 and J2054 are higher for brighter galaxies at short angular separations, suggesting preferential enhancement of more massive galaxies in the immediate vicinity of the quasar. Finally, we compare the LBG population with previously-identified [CII] and mm-continuum companions; the LBG overdensities are not accompanied by an enhanced number of dusty galaxies, suggesting that the overdense quasar fields are not in the bursty star-forming phase sometimes seen in high-redshift protoclusters.\n"

      "2        This thesis explores the effects of <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> (DM) on neutron stars (NSs) using the relativistic mean-field (RMF) model. The effects of DM on NS properties, including the mass-radius relation, the moment of inertia, and tidal deformability, are calculated by varying its fraction. The study found that the EOS becomes softer with increasing DM momentum, and the DM has marginal effects on nuclear <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> properties, except for the EOSs and binding energy per particle. The study also calculated the properties of isolated, static, and rotating DM admixed NS and found that the DM has significant effects on both static and rotating NS. We have also observed that a tiny amount of DM can accumulate inside the NS, and more amount of it makes the NS unstable. The study also suggests that the secondary component might be a NS with DM content if the underlying nuclear EOS is sufficiently stiff. The $f$-mode oscillations of the DM admixed hyperon stars are calculated and found that there exist a correlation between canonical $f$-mode frequency and the dimensionless tidal deformability parameter ($Λ_{1.4}$) and we have put a constraint on $f$-mode frequency using GW170817 data. Finally, we have calculated the DM admixed binary NS properties and found that the binary system becomes less deformed and sustains more time in its inspiral phases with the addition of DM. Therefore, we suggest that one can take DM inside the compact objects while modeling the inspiral waveforms for the BNS systems.\n",
      "3        Radiative emissions from electrons and positrons generated by <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> (DM) annihilation or decay are one of the most investigated signals in indirect searches of WIMPs. Ideal targets must have large ratio of DM to baryonic <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>. However, such ``<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span>&#39;&#39; systems have a poorly known level of magnetic turbulence, which determines the residence time of the electrons and positrons and therefore also the strength of the expected signal. This typically leads to significant uncertainties in the derived DM bounds. In a novel approach, we compute the self-confinement of the DM-induced electrons and positrons. Indeed, they themselves generate irregularities in the magnetic field, thus setting a lower limit on the presence of the magnetic turbulence. We specifically apply this approach to dwarf spheroidal galaxies. Finally, by comparing the expected synchrotron emission with radio data from the direction of the Draco galaxy collected at the Giant Metre Radio Telescope, we show that the proposed approach can be used to set robust and competitive bounds on WIMP DM.\n",
      "4        The particle origin of <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> (DM) is still one of the main puzzles in modern physics. One of the most promising search strategy to detect DM at laboratories is through the indirect search of cosmic particles that are produced from DM annihilation in space. In particular, the flux of cosmic positrons has been measured with high precision by the AMS-02 experiment demonstrating that an excess above 10 GeV, with respect to the secondary production, is present. We study in this paper the possible DM origin of the positron excess finding the values of the DM mass $M$ and annihilation cross section $\\langle σv \\rangle$ that are needed to fit high-energy positron data. In particular, we find that for DM annihilating into $b\\bar{b}$ it is required to have $M=43$ TeV and $\\langle σv \\rangle = 10^{-21}$ cm$^3$/s while for $τ^+τ^-$ $M=2$ TeV and $\\langle σv \\rangle = 3\\times 10^{-23}$ cm$^3$/s. If DM produce positrons, they are expected to generate gamma rays from the center of the Milky Way and around dwarf galaxy satellites of the Galaxy. We thus combine the values for the DM mass and annihilation cross section obtained with the fit to AMS-02 positron data with the upper limits derived with the non-detection of $γ$ rays with HESS in the direction of the Galactic center and Fermi-LAT for the combined analysis of dwarf galaxies. The main result of the paper is that only DM annihilating into $μ^+ μ^-$ with a mass around 500 GeV and $\\langle σv \\rangle = 4\\times 10^{-24}$ cm$^3$/s can fit AMS-02 data and be compatible with the upper limits found with $γ$ rays. As for the $τ^+ τ^-$ ($b\\bar{b}$) channel, DM can contribute at most at a few tens $\\%$ (a few \\%) level.\n",

We study a semi-analytical subhalo model for interacting <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> with radiation, based on the extended Press-Schechter formalism and subhalos&#39; tidal evolution prescription. We also test the elastic scattering between DM and neutrinos using observations of Milky-Way satellites from the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">Dark</span> Energy Survey and PanSTARRS1.

      "6        Numerous observations suggest that there exist undiscovered beyond-the-Standard-Model particles and fields. Because of their unknown nature, these exotic particles and fields could interact with Standard Model particles in many different ways and assume a variety of possible configurations. Here we present an overview of the Global Network of Optical Magnetometers for Exotic physics searches (GNOME), our ongoing experimental program designed to test a wide range of exotic physics scenarios. The GNOME experiment utilizes a worldwide network of shielded atomic magnetometers (and, more recently, comagnetometers) to search for spatially and temporally correlated signals due to torques on atomic spins from exotic fields of astrophysical origin. We survey the temporal characteristics of a variety of possible signals currently under investigation such as those from topological defect <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> (axion-like particle domain walls), axion-like particle stars, solitons of complex-valued scalar fields (Q-balls), stochastic fluctuations of bosonic <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> fields, a solar axion-like particle halo, and bursts of ultralight bosonic fields produced by cataclysmic astrophysical events such as binary black hole mergers.\n",
      "7        Recent observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) are yielding tantalizing hints of an early population of massive, bright galaxies at $z &gt; 10$, with Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) observations indicating significant dust masses in place as early as $z\\sim 7$. To understand the implications of these observations, we use the DELPHI semi-analytic model that jointly tracks the assembly of <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halos and their constituent baryons, including the key processes of dust enrichment. Our model employs only two redshift- and mass-independent free parameters that are tuned against all available galaxy data at $z \\sim 5-9$ before it is used to make predictions up to $z \\sim 20$. Our key results are: (1) the model progressively under-predicts the observed ultraviolet luminosity function (UV LF) at $z &gt; 12$; observations at $z&gt;16$ lie close to, or even above, a &#34;maximal&#34; model where all available gas is turned into stars; (2) UV selection would miss 34% of the star formation rate density at $z \\sim 5$, decreasing to 17% by $z \\sim 10$ for bright galaxies with $\\rm{M_{UV}} &lt; -19$; (3) the dust mass ($M_d$) evolves with the stellar mass ($M_*$) and redshift as $\\log(M_d) = 1.194\\log(M_*) + 0.0975z - 5.433$; (4) the escape fraction of UV photons ($f_{\\rm esc}^{\\rm UV}$) decreases with increasing mass and star formation rate. At $z \\sim 7$, $f_{\\rm esc}^{\\rm UV} \\sim 0.8~(0.1)$ for $M_* \\sim 10^9~ (10^{11}) \\, M_\\odot$ galaxies; (5) the dust temperature increases with stellar mass, ranging between $30-33$ K for $M_* \\sim 10^{9-11}M_\\odot$ galaxies at $z \\sim 7$. Finally, we predict the far infrared (FIR) LF at $z \\sim 5-20$, testable with ALMA observations, and caution that spectroscopic redshifts and dust masses must be pinned down before invoking unphysical extrema in galaxy formation models.\n",
      "8        We reexamine the consequences of perturbative unitarity on <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> freeze-out when both Sommerfeld enhancement and bound state formation affect <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> annihilations. At leading order (LO) the annihilation cross-section is infrared dominated and the connection between the unitarity bound and the upper bound on the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> mass depends only on how the different partial waves are populated. We compute how this picture is modified at next-to-leading order (NLO) with the goal of assigning a reliable theory uncertainty to the freeze-out predictions. We explicitly compute NLO corrections in a simple model with abelian gauge interactions and provide an estimate of the theoretical uncertainty for the thermal masses of heavy electroweak $n$-plets. Along the way, we clarify the regularization and matching procedure necessary to deal with singular potentials in quantum mechanics with a calculable relativistic UV completion.\n",
      "9        We provide an algorithm for evolving general spin-$s$ Gross-Pitaevskii / non-linear Schrödinger systems carrying a variety of interactions, where the $2s+1$ components of the `spinor&#39; field represent the different spin-multiplicity states. We consider many nonrelativistic interactions up to quartic order in the Schrödinger field (both short and long-range, and spin-dependent and spin-independent interactions), including explicit spin-orbit couplings. The algorithm allows for spatially varying external and/or self-generated vector potentials that couple to the spin density of the field. Our work can be used for scenarios ranging from laboratory systems such as spinor Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs), to cosmological/astrophysical systems such as self-interacting bosonic <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>.

      "10        We discuss the production of primordial black holes in an early <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> dominated era, which typically takes place in string inspired early universe cosmological models. In particular, we consider a pre-big bang scenario (extending previous results regarding formation in the radiation dominated era) where the enhancement of curvature perturbations is induced by a variation of the sound-speed parameter c_s during the string phase of high-curvature inflation. After imposing all relevant observational constraints, we find that the considered class of models is compatible with the production of a large amount of primordial black holes, in the mass range relevant to <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>, only for a small range of the parameters space.

An indication for a non-zero coupling between <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> and neutrinos (both assuming a temperature independent and $T^2$ dependent cross-section) is obtained at the 1$σ$ level coming from the ACT CMB data alone and when combined with the Planck CMB and Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) measurements. This result is confirmed by both fixing the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom in the early Universe to the Standard Model value of $N_{\\rm eff}=3.044$, and allowing $N_{\\rm eff}$ to be a free cosmological parameter. Furthermore, when performing a Bayesian model comparison, the interacting $ν$DM (+$N_{\\rm eff}$) scenario is mostly preferred over a baseline $Λ$CDM (+$N_{\\rm eff}$) cosmology.

      "13        The <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> power spectrum has been strongly constrained by astronomical measurements at large scales, but only weakly at small scales.

The $\\ell$-boson stars are numerical solutions to the non-relativistic limit of the Einstein-Klein-Gordon system, the Schrödinger-Poisson (SP) system. These solutions are parametrized by an angular momentum number $\\ell = (N-1)/2$ and an excitation number $n$. We perform a bayesian analysis by modifying the SimpleMC code to perform the parameter inference, for the cases with $\\ell = 0$, $\\ell = 1$ and multistates of $\\ell$-boson stars. We used the Akaike information criterion (AIC), Bayesian information criterion and the Bayes factor to compare the excited state ($\\ell$=1) and the multistate case with the ground state ($\\ell$=0) as the base model due to its simplicity. We found that the data in most galaxies in the sample favours the multistates case and that the scalar field mass tends to be slightly bigger than the ground state case.\n",
      "15        A long-standing observed curiosity of globular clusters (GCs) has been that both the number and total mass of GCs in a galaxy are linearly correlated with the galaxy&#39;s virial mass, whereas its stellar component shows no such linear correlation. This work expands on an empirical model for the numbers and ages of GCs in galaxies presented by Valenzuela et al. (2021) that is consistent with recent observational data from massive elliptical galaxies down to the dwarf galaxy regime. Applying the model to simulations, GC numbers are shown to be excellent tracers for the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> (DM) virial mass, even when distinct formation mechanisms are employed for blue and red GCs. Furthermore, the amount of DM smooth accretion is encoded in the GC abundances, therefore providing a measure for an otherwise nearly untraceable component of the formation history of galaxies.\n",
      "16        We analytically solve the problem of Bose star growth in the bath of gravitationally interacting particles. We find that after nucleation of this object, the bath is described by a self-similar solution of the kinetic equation, which is an attractor. Together with the conservation laws, this fixes mass evolution of the Bose star. Our results explain slowdown of the star growth at a certain &#34;core-halo&#34; mass, but also predict formation of the heavier and lighter objects in magistral <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> models.\n",
      "17        <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">Dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> subhaloes are key for the predictions of simulations of structure formation, but their existence frequently ends prematurely due to two technical issues, namely numerical disruption in N-body simulations and halo finders failing to identify them. Here we focus on the second issue, using the phase-space friends-of-friends halo finder ROCKSTAR as a benchmark (though we expect our results to translate to comparable codes). We confirm that the most prominent cause for losing track of subhaloes is tidal distortion rather than a low number of particles. As a solution, we present a flexible post-processing algorithm that tracks all subhalo particles over time, computes subhalo positions and masses based on those particles, and progressively removes stripped <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>. If a subhalo is lost by the halo finder, this algorithm keeps tracking its so-called ghost until it has almost no particles left or has truly merged with its host. We apply this technique to a large suite of N-body simulations and restore lost subhaloes to the halo catalogues, which has a dramatic effect on key summary statistics of large-scale structure. Specifically, the subhalo mass function increases by about 50% and the halo correlation function increases by a factor of two at small scales. While these quantitative results are somewhat specific to our algorithm, they demonstrate that particle tracking is a promising way to reliably follow haloes and reduce the need for orphan models. Our algorithm and augmented halo catalogues are publicly available.\n",

The black hole superradiance mechanism allows for these particles to be probed using only their gravitational interaction. In this scenario, an ultralight boson cloud may form spontaneously around a spinning black hole and extract a non-negligible fraction of the black hole&#39;s mass. These oscillating clouds produce quasi-monochromatic, long-duration gravitational waves that may be detectable by ground-based or space-based gravitational wave detectors. We discuss the capability of a new long-duration signal tracking method, based on a hidden Markov model, to detect gravitational wave signals generated by ultralight vector boson clouds, including cases where the signal frequency evolution timescale is much shorter than that of a typical continuous wave signal. We quantify the detection horizon distances for vector boson clouds with current- and next-generation ground-based detectors. We demonstrate that vector clouds hosted by black holes with mass $\\gtrsim 60 M_{\\odot}$ and spin $\\gtrsim 0.6$ are within the reach of current-generation detectors up to a luminosity distance of $\\sim 1$ Gpc. This search method enables one to target vector boson clouds around remnant black holes from compact binary mergers detected by gravitational-wave detectors. We discuss the impact of the sky localization of the merger events and demonstrate that a typical remnant black hole reasonably well-localized by the current generation detector network is accessible in a follow-up search.\n",
      "19        Lithium-drifted silicon [Si(Li)] has been used for decades as an ionizing radiation detector in nuclear, particle, and astrophysical experiments, though such detectors have frequently been limited to small sizes (few cm$^2$) and cryogenic operating temperatures. The 10-cm-diameter Si(Li) detectors developed for the General Antiparticle Spectrometer (GAPS) balloon-borne <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> experiment are novel particularly for their requirements of low cost, large sensitive area (~10 m$^2$ for the full 1440-detector array), high temperatures (near -40$\\,^\\circ$C), and energy resolution below 4 keV FWHM for 20--100-keV x-rays. Previous works have discussed the manufacturing, passivation, and small-scale testing of prototype GAPS Si(Li) detectors. Here we show for the first time the results from detailed characterization of over 1100 flight detectors, illustrating the consistent intrinsic low-noise performance of a large sample of GAPS detectors. This work demonstrates the feasibility of large-area and low-cost Si(Li) detector arrays for next-generation astrophysics and nuclear physics applications.\n",

The boosted <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">Dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">Matter</span> flux at the edge of the Earth&#39;s atmosphere is expected to be pointing to the Galactic Center, with a flux 15 to 20 times larger than in the transverse direction.\n",
      "21        We investigate the reach of future gravitational wave (GW) detectors in probing inflaton couplings with visible sector particles that can either be bosonic or fermionic in nature. Assuming reheating takes place through perturbative quantum production from vacuum in presence of classical inflaton background field, we find that the spectral energy density of the primordial GW generated during inflation becomes sensitive to inflaton-<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> coupling. We conclude, obeying bounds from Big Bang Nucleosysthesis and Cosmic Microwave Background, that, e.g., inflaton-scalar couplings of the order of $\\sim\\mathcal{O}(10^{-20})$ GeV fall within the sensitivity range of several proposed GW detector facilities. However, this prediction is sensitive to the size of the inflationary scale, nature of the inflaton-<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> interaction and shape of the potential during reheating. Having found the time-dependent effective inflaton decay width, we also discuss its implications for <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> (DM) production from the thermal plasma via UV freeze-in during reheating. It is shown, that one can reproduce the observed DM abundance for its mass up to several PeVs, depending on the dimension of the operator connecting DM with the thermal bath and the associated scale of the UV physics. Thus we promote primordial GW to observables sensitive to feebly coupled inflaton, which is very challenging if not impossible to test in conventional particle physics laboratories or astrophysical measurements.\n",
      "22        We argue that demanding a consistent cosmological history, including the absence of domain walls and strongly interacting relics at the Peccei-Quinn scale, singles out two concrete realizations of hadronic QCD axions as viable <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> models. These realizations generally feature flavor-violating axion couplings to Standard Model quarks that are unsuppressed at low energies. As a consequence, experiments looking for flavor-violating hadronic processes involving the axion can be sensitive probes of QCD axion <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> models. In particular, we show that the NA62 and KOTO experiments could detect the $K\\rightarrowπ+ a$ decay for axions consistent with the observed <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> abundance via the post-inflationary misalignment mechanism.\n",
      "23        The mean <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> density within the turnaround radius, which is the boundary that separates a nonexpanding structure from the Hubble flow, was recently proposed as a novel cosmological probe. According to the spherical collapse model, the evolution with cosmic time of this turnaround density, $\\rm ρ_{ta}(z)$, can be used to determine both $\\rm Ω_m$ and $Ω_Λ$, independently of any other currently used probe. The properties of $\\rm ρ_{ta}$ predicted by the spherical collapse model were also shown to persist in the presence of full three-dimensional effects in $\\rm Λ$CDM N-body cosmological simulations when considering galaxy clusters at the present time, $z=0$. However, a small offset was discovered between the spherical-collapse prediction of the value of $ρ_{ta}$ at $z=0$ and its value measured in simulations. In this letter, we explore whether this offset evolves with cosmic time; whether it differs in different cosmologies; whether its origin can be confidently identified; and whether it can be corrected. We found that the offset does evolve slightly with redshift, and that it correlates strongly with the deviation from spherical symmetry of the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halo distribution inside and outside of the turnaround radius. We used an appropriate metric to quantify deviations in the environment of a structure from spherical symmetry. We found that using this metric, we can construct a sphericity-selected sample of halos for which the offset of $ρ_{ta}$ from the spherical collapse prediction is zero, independently of redshift and cosmology. We found that a sphericity-selected halo sample allows us to recover the simulated cosmology, and we conclude that the turnaround density evolution indeed encodes the cosmology in N-body simulations.\n",
      "24        We present a new suite of over 1,500 cosmological N-body simulations with varied Warm <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">Dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">Matter</span> (WDM) models ranging from 2.5 to 30 keV. We use these simulations to train Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to infer WDM particle masses from images of DM field data. Our fiducial setup can make accurate predictions of the WDM particle mass up to 7.5 keV at a 95% confidence level from small maps that cover an area of (25 h$^{-1}$ Mpc)$^2$. We vary the image resolution, simulation resolution, redshift, and cosmology of our fiducial setup to better understand how our model is making predictions. Using these variations, we find that our models are most dependent on simulation resolution, minimally dependent on image resolution, not systematically dependent on redshift, and robust to varied cosmologies. We also find that an important feature to distinguish between WDM models is present with a linear size between 100 and 200 h$^{-1}$ kpc. We compare our fiducial model to one trained on the power spectrum alone and find that our field-level model can make 2x more precise predictions and can make accurate predictions to 2x as massive WDM particle masses when used on the same data. Overall, we find that the field-level data can be used to accurately differentiate between WDM models and contain more information than is captured by the power spectrum. This technique can be extended to more complex DM models and opens up new opportunities to explore alternative DM models in a cosmological environment.\n",
      "25        The properties of globular clusters (GCs) contain valuable information of their host galaxies and <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span>-<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halos. In the remarkable example of ultra-diffuse galaxy, NGC5846-UDG1, the GC population exhibits strong radial mass segregation, indicative of dynamical-friction-driven orbital decay, which opens the possibility of using imaging data alone to constrain the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span>-<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> content of the galaxy. To explore this possibility, we develop a semi-analytical model of GC evolution, which starts from the initial mass function, the initial structure-mass relation, and the initial spatial distribution of the GC progenitors, and follows the effects of dynamical friction, tidal evolution, and two-body relaxation. Using Markov Chain Monte Carlo, we forward-model the GCs in a NGC5846-UDG1-like potential to match the observed GC mass, size, and spatial distributions, and to constrain the profile of the host halo and the origin of the GCs. We find that, with the assumptions of zero mass segregation when the star clusters were born, NGC5846-UDG1 is <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span>-<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> poor compared to what is expected from stellar-to-halo-mass relations, and its halo concentration is low, irrespective of having a cuspy or a cored halo profile. Its GC population has an initial spatial distribution more extended than the smooth stellar distribution. We discuss the results in the context of scaling laws of galaxy-halo connections, and warn against naively using the GC-abundance-halo-mass relation to infer the halo mass of UDGs. Our model is generally applicable to GC-rich dwarf galaxies, and is publicly available at https://github.com/JiangFangzhou/GCevo.\n",
      "26        The Epoch of Reionization (EoR) neutral Hydrogen (HI) 21-cm signal evolves significantly along the line-of-sight (LoS) due to the light-cone (LC) effect. It is important to accurately incorporate this in simulations in order to correctly interpret the signal. 21-cm LC simulations are typically produced by stitching together slices from a finite number $(N_{\\rm RS})$ of &#39;&#39;reionization snapshot&#39;&#39;, each corresponding to a different stage of reionization. In this paper, we have quantified the errors in the 21-cm LC simulation due to the finite value of $N_{\\rm RS}$. We show that this can introduce large discontinuities $(&gt; 200 \\%)$ at the stitching boundaries when $N_{\\rm RS}$ is small $(= 2,4)$ and the mean neutral fraction jumps by $δ\\bar{x}_{\\rm HI} = 0.2,0.1$ respectively at the stitching boundaries. This drops to $17 \\%$ for $N_{\\rm RS} = 13$ where $δ\\bar{x}_{\\rm HI}=0.02$. We present and also validate a method for mitigating this error by increasing $N_{\\rm RS}$ without a proportional increase in the computational costs which are mainly incurred in generating the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> and halo density fields. Our method generates these fields only at a few redshifts, and interpolates them to generate reionization snapshots at closely spaced redshifts. We use this to generate 21-cm LC simulations with $N_{\\rm RS} = 26,51,101$ and $201$, and show that the errors go down as $N_{\\rm RS}^{-1}$.\n",
      "27        The advent of gravitational wave astronomy has seen a huge influx of new predictions for potential discoveries of beyond the Standard Model fields. The coupling of all fundamental fields to gravity, together with its dominance on large scales, makes gravitational physics a rich laboratory to study fundamental physics. This holds especially true for the search for the elusive <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> photon, a promising <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> candidate. The <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> photon is predicted to generate instabilities in a rotating black hole spacetime, birthing a macroscopic Bose-Einstein condensate. These condensates can especially form around super massive black holes, modifying the dynamical inspiralling process. This then opens another window to leverage future space-borne gravitational wave antennas to join the hunt for the elusive <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> particle. This study builds a preliminary model for the gravitational waveform emitted by such a dressed extreme mass-ratio inspiral. Comparing these waveforms to the vacuum scenario allows projections to the potential constrainability on the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> photon mass by space-borne gravitational wave antennas. The superradiant instability of a massive vector field on a Kerr background is calculated and the modification to the dynamics of an inspiralling solar mass-scale compact object is determined with approximations on the backreaction effect of the cloud on the compact object. The end result is the projection that the LISA mission should be able to constrain the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> photon mass using extreme mass ratio inspirals in the range $[1.8 \\times 10^{-17}, 4.47 \\times 10^{-16}]$ eV.\n",
      "28        Recent observations made by the JWST have revealed a number of massive galaxies at high redshift ($z$). The presence of these galaxies appears at odds with the current $Λ$CDM cosmology. Here we investigate the possibility of alleviating the tension by incorporating uncertainties from three sources in counting massive galaxies at high $z$: cosmic variance, error in stellar mass estimate, and contribution by backsplash. We find that each of the sources can significantly increase the cumulative stellar mass density $ρ_*(&gt;M_*)$ at the high-mass end, and the combination of them can boost the density by more than one order of magnitude. Assuming a star formation efficiency of $ε_* \\sim 0.5$, cosmic variance alone can reduce the tension to $2σ$ level, except the most massive galaxy at $z=8$. Including in addition a lognormal dispersion with a width of 0.3 dex in the stellar mass can bring the observed stellar mass density at $z \\sim 7 - 10$ to the $2σ$ range of the cosmic variance. The tension is completely eliminated when gas stripped from backsplash halos is also taken into account. Our results highlight the importance of fully modeling uncertainties when interpreting observational data of rare objects. We use the constrained simulation, ELUCID, to investigate the descendants of high $z$ massive galaxies. We find that a significant portion of these galaxies end up in massive halos with mass $M_{\\rm halo} &gt; 10^{13} h^{-1}M_\\odot $ at $z=0$. A large fraction of central galaxies in $M_{\\rm halo} \\geqslant 10^{14.5} h^{-1}M_\\odot$ halos today are predicted to contain significant amounts of ancient stars formed in massive galaxies at $z\\sim 8$. This prediction can be tested by studying the structure and stellar population of central galaxies in present-day massive clusters.\n",
      "29        Within the $Λ$CDM cosmology, <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> haloes are comprised of both a smooth component and a population of smaller, gravitationally bound subhaloes. These components are often treated as a single halo when halo properties, such as density profiles, are extracted from simulations. Recent work has shown that density profiles change substantially when subhalo mass is excluded. In this paper, we expand on this result by analysing the change in three specific host halo properties -- concentration ($c_{\\rm{NFW}}$), spin ($λ_{\\rm Bullock}$), and shape ($c/a$), -- when calculated only from the smooth component of the halo. This analysis is performed on both Milky Way-mass haloes and cluster-mass haloes in high-resolution, zoom-in, $N$-body simulations. We find that when subhaloes are excluded the median value of (1) $c_{\\rm{NFW}}$ is enhanced by $\\approx 38 \\pm 12\\%$ and $\\approx 88 \\pm 7.7\\%$ for Milky Way mass ($10^{12.1}\\,\\text{M}_\\odot$) and cluster mass ($10^{14.8}\\,\\text{M}_\\odot$) haloes respectively, (2) $λ_{\\rm Bullock}$ is reduced for Milky Way mass by $\\approx 16 \\pm 6.8\\%$ and cluster mass haloes by $\\approx 32 \\pm 8.9\\%$. Additionally, with the removal of subhaloes, cluster mass haloes tend to become more spherical as the ratio of minor-to-major axis, $c/a$, increases by $\\approx 12 \\pm 4\\%$, whereas Milky Way mass haloes remain approximately the same shape with $c/a$ changed by $\\approx 1.2 \\pm 5.6\\%$. The fractional change of each of these properties depends primarily on the amount of mass that is removed from the halo system and, to a lesser extent, mass accretion history. Our findings demonstrate that the properties of the smooth components of <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> haloes are biased relative to the total mass of the halo including subhaloes.\n",
      "30        In order to test active galactic nucleus (AGN) unification and evolutionary models, we measured the AGN clustering properties as a function of AGN obscuration defined in terms of hydrogen column density, $N_{\\rm H}$. In addition to measuring the clustering of unobscured ($N_{\\rm H} &lt; 10^{22}\\,{\\rm cm}^{-2}$) and moderately obscured ($10^{22} \\leq N_{\\rm H} &lt; 10^{23.5}$) AGNs, we also targeted highly obscured sources ($N_{\\rm H}\\geq 10^{23.5}$) up to redshifts of $z=3$. We have compiled one of the largest samples of X-ray-selected AGNs from a total of eight deep XMM/Chandra surveys. We measured the clustering as a function of both AGN obscuration and redshift using the projected two-point correlation function, $w_{\\rm p}(r_{\\rm p})$. We modeled the large-scale clustering signal, measured the AGN bias, $b(z, N_{\\rm H})$, and interpreted it in terms of the typical AGN host <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halo, $M_{\\rm halo}(z, N_{\\rm H}$). We find no significant dependence of AGN clustering on obscuration, suggesting similar typical masses of the hosting halos as a function of $N_{\\rm H}$. This result matches expectations of AGN unification models, in which AGN obscuration depends mainly on the viewing angle of the obscuring torus. We measured, for the first time, the clustering of highly obscured AGNs and find that these objects reside in halos with typical mass $\\log M_{\\rm halo} = 12.98_{-0.22}^{+0.17} [h^{-1} M_\\odot]$ ($12.28_{-0.19}^{+0.13}$) at low $z \\sim 0.7$ (high $z \\sim 1.8$) redshifts. We find that irrespective of obscuration, an increase in AGN bias with redshift is slower than the expectation for a constant halo mass and instead follows the growth rate of halos, known as the passive evolution track. This implies that for those AGNs the clustering is mainly driven by the mass growth rate of the hosting halos and galaxies across cosmic time.\n",
      "31        Mergers between galaxy clusters are an important stage in the formation of the large-scale structure of the Universe. Some of the mergers show a spectacular bow shock that formed as a result of recent passage of a smaller cluster through a bigger one, the classic example of this being the so-called bullet cluster. In this paper, I describe ten examples of interacting clusters identified among 200 of the most massive objects, with total masses above $1.4 \\times 10^{14}$ M$_{\\odot}$, from the IllustrisTNG300 simulation by searching for prominent bow shocks in their temperature maps. Despite different mass ratios of the two merging clusters, the events are remarkably similar in many respects. In all cases, the companion cluster passed close to the main one only once, between 0.9 and 0.3 Gyr ago, with the pericenter distance of 100-530 kpc and a velocity of up to 3400 km s$^{-1}$. The subcluster, typically an order of magnitude smaller in mass than the main cluster before the interaction, loses most of its <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> and gas in the process. The displacement between the collisionless part of the remnant and the bow shock is such that the remnant typically lags behind the shock or coincides with it, with a single exception of the merger occurring with the largest velocity. Usually about 1% of the gas cells in the merging clusters are shocked, and the median Mach numbers of these gas cells are around two. Due to the relatively small size of the simulation box, no close analog of the bullet cluster was found, but I identified one case that is similar in terms of mass, velocity, and displacement. The presented cases bear more resemblance to less extreme observed interacting clusters such as A520 and Coma.\n",
      "32        Microscopic horizonless relics could form in the early universe either directly through gravitational collapse or as stable remnants of the Hawking evaporation of primordial black holes. In both cases they completely or partially evade cosmological constraints arising from Hawking evaporation and in certain mass ranges can explain the entirety of the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>. We systematically explore the stochastic gravitational-wave background associated with the formation of microscopic <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span>-<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> relics in various scenarios, adopting an agnostic approach and discussing the limitations introduced by existing constraints, possible ways to circumvent the latter, and expected astrophysical foregrounds.

      "33        In direct <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> (DM) detection via scattering off the electrons, the momentum transfer plays a crucial role. Previous work showed that for self-interacting DM, if the DM particle has a size (the so-called puffy DM), the radius effect could dominate the momentum transfer and become another source of velocity dependence for self-scattering cross section. In this work we investigate the direct detection of puffy DM particles with different radii through electron recoil. We find that comparing with the available experimental exclusion limits dominated by the mediator effect for XENON10, XENON100 and XENON1T, the constraints on the puffy DM-electron scattering cross-section become much weaker for large radius DM particles. For small-radius DM particles, the constraints remain similar to the point-like DM case.\n",
      "34        Boson stars are gravitationally bound objects that arise in ultralight <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> models and form in the centers of galactic halos or axion miniclusters. We systematically study the excitations of a boson star, taking into account the mixing between positive and negative frequencies introduced by gravity. We show that the spectrum contains zero-energy modes in the monopole and dipole sectors resulting from spontaneous symmetry breaking by the boson star background. We analyze the general properties of the eigenmodes and derive their orthogonality and completeness conditions which have non-standard form due to the positive-negative frequency mixing. The eigenvalue problem is solved numerically for the first few energy levels in different multipole sectors and the results are compared to the solutions of the Schrödinger equation in fixed boson star gravitational potential. The two solutions differ significantly for the lowest modes, but get close for higher levels. We further confirm the normal mode spectrum in 3D wave simulations where we inject perturbations with different multipoles. As an application of the normal mode solutions, we compute the matrix element entering the evaporation rate of a boson star immersed in a hot axion gas. The computation combines the use of exact wavefunctions for the low-lying bound states and of the Schrödinger approximation for the high-energy excitations.\n",
      "35        If long-range attractive forces exist and are stronger than gravity then cosmic halo formation can begin in the radiation-dominated era. We study a simple realization of this effect in a system where <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> fermions have Yukawa interactions mediated by scalar particles, analogous to the Higgs boson in the standard model. We develop a self-consistent description of the system including exact background dynamics of the scalar field, and precise modelling of the fermion density fluctuations. For the latter, we provide accurate approximations for the linear growth as well as quantitative modelling of the nonlinear evolution using N-body simulations. We find that halo formation occurs exponentially fast and on scales substantially larger than simple estimates predict. The final fate of these halos remains uncertain, but could be annihilation, <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> stars, primordial black holes, or even the existence of galaxy-sized halos at <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>-radiation equality. More generally, our results demonstrate the importance of mapping scalar-mediated interactions onto structure formation outcomes and constraints for beyond the standard model theories.\n",
      "36        Recent analysis on the stellar kinematics of ultra-faint dwarf (UFD) galaxies has put a stringent upper limit on the self-scattering cross section of <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>, i.e., $σ/m&lt;{\\cal O}(0.1)\\,{\\rm cm^2/g}$ at the scattering velocity of ${\\cal O}(10)\\,{\\rm km/s}$. Resonant self-interacting <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> (rSIDM) is one possibility that can be consistent with the UFDs and explain the low central densities of rotation-supported galaxies; the cross section is resonantly enhanced to be $σ/m = {\\cal O}(1)\\,{\\rm cm^2/g}$ around the scattering velocity of ${\\cal O}(100)\\,{\\rm km/s}$ while being suppressed at lower velocities. To further assess this possibility, since the inferred <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> distribution of halos from astrophysical observations is usually compared to that in constant-cross section SIDM (cSIDM), whether the structures of rSIDM halos can be approximated by the cSIDM halo profiles needs to be clarified. In this work, we employ the grovothermal fluid method to investigate the structural evolution of rSIDM halos in a wide mass range. We find that except for halos in a specific mass range, the present structures of rSIDM halos are virtually indistinguishable from those of the cSIDM halos. For halos in the specific mass range, the resonant self-scattering renders a break in their density profile. We demonstrate how such a density-profile break appears in astrophysical observations, e.g., rotation curves and line-of-sight velocity dispersion profiles. We show that for halos above the specific mass range, the density-profile break thermalizes to disappear before the present. We demonstrate that such distinctive thermalization dynamics can leave imprints on the orbital classes of stars with similar ages and metallicities.\n",
      "37        The E-type $α$-attractor models of single-field inflation were generalized further in order to accommodate production of primordial black holes (PBH) via adding a near-inflection point to the inflaton scalar potential at smaller scales, in good agreement with measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation. A minimal number of new parameters was used but their fine-tuning was maximized in order to increase possible masses of PBH formed during an ultra-slow-roll phase leading to a large enhancement of the power spectrum of scalar (curvature) perturbations by 6 or 7 orders of magnitude against the power spectrum of perturbations observed in CMB. It was found that extreme fine-tuning of the parameters in our models can lead to a formation of the Earth-size PBH with the masses of approximately $10^{27}$ g, still in agreement with CMB observations. Quantum corrections are known to lead to the perturbative upper bound on the amplitude of large scalar perturbations responsible for PBH production. The quantum (one-loop) corrections in our models were found to be suppressed by one order of magnitude for PBH with the masses of approximately $10^{19}$ g, which may form the whole <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> in the Universe.\n",

We study the requirements the model&#39;s parameters have to fulfill in order to reproduce the measured DM relic abundance through two possible production mechanisms in the early universe, freeze-in and misalignment, both during a standard radiation-dominated era and early <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> domination. We then study possible signals of type-II majoron DM and the present and expected constraints on the parameter space that can be obtained from cosmological observations, direct detection experiments, and present and future searches for decaying DM at neutrino telescopes and cosmic-ray experiments. We find that -- depending on the majoron mass, the production mechanism, and the value of the vacuum expectation value of the type-II triplet -- all of the three decay modes (photons, electrons, neutrinos) of majoron DM particles can yield observable signals at future indirect searches for DM. Furthermore, in a corner of the parameter space, detection of majoron DM is possible through electron recoil at running and future direct detection experiments.\n",
      "39        Running vacuum models and viscous <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> scenarios beyond perfect fluid idealization are two appealing theoretical strategies that have been separately studied as alternatives to solve some problems rooted in the $Λ$CDM cosmological model. In this paper, we combine these two notions in a single cosmological setting and investigate their cosmological implications, paying particular attention in the interplay between these two constituents in different cosmological periods. Specifically, we consider a well-studied running vacuum model inspired by renormalization group, and a recently proposed general parameterization for the bulk viscosity $ξ$. By employing dynamical system analysis, we explore the physical aspects of the new phase space that emerges from the combined models and derive stability conditions that ensure complete cosmological dynamics. We identify four distinct classes of models and find that the critical points of the phase space are non-trivially renewed compared to the single scenarios. We then proceed, in a joint and complementary way to the dynamical system analysis, with a detailed numerical exploration to quantify the impact of both the running parameter and the bulk viscosity coefficient on the cosmological evolution. Thus, for some values of the model parameters, numerical solutions show qualitative differences from the $Λ$CDM model, which is phenomenologically appealing in light of cosmological observations.\n",
      "40        The intrinsic alignment (IA) of observed galaxy shapes with the underlying cosmic web is a source of contamination in weak lensing surveys. Sensitive methods to identify the IA signal will therefore need to be included in the upcoming weak lensing analysis pipelines. Hydrodynamical cosmological simulations allow us to directly measure the intrinsic ellipticities of galaxies and thus provide a powerful approach to predict and understand the IA signal. Here we employ the novel, large-volume hydrodynamical simulation MTNG740, a product of the MillenniumTNG (MTNG) project, to study the IA of galaxies. We measure the projected correlation functions between the intrinsic shape/shear of galaxies and various tracers of large-scale structure, $w_{+g},\\ w_{+m},\\ w_{++}$ over the radial range $r_{\\rm p} \\in [0.02 , 200]\\,h^{-1}{\\rm Mpc}$ and at redshifts $z=0.0$, $0.5$ and $1.0$. We detect significant signal-to-noise IA signals with the density field for both elliptical and spiral galaxies. We also find significant intrinsic shear-shear correlations for ellipticals. We further examine correlations of the intrinsic shape of galaxies with the local tidal field. Here we find a significant IA signal for elliptical galaxies assuming a linear model. We also detect a weak IA signal for spiral galaxies under a quadratic tidal torquing model. Lastly, we measure the alignment between central galaxies and their host <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span>-<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halos, finding small to moderate misalignments between their principal axes that decline with halo mass.\n",
      "41        We study weak gravitational lensing convergence maps produced from the MillenniumTNG (MTNG) simulations by direct projection of the mass distribution on the past backwards lightcone of a fiducial observer. We explore the lensing maps over a large dynamic range in simulation mass and angular resolution, allowing us to establish a clear assessment of numerical convergence. By comparing full physics hydrodynamical simulations with corresponding <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span>-<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>-only runs we quantify the impact of baryonic physics on the most important weak lensing statistics. Likewise, we predict the impact of massive neutrinos reliably far into the non-linear regime. We also demonstrate that the &#34;fixed &amp; paired&#34; variance suppression technique increases the statistical robustness of the simulation predictions on large scales not only for time slices but also for continuously output lightcone data. We find that both baryonic and neutrino effects substantially impact weak lensing shear measurements, with the latter dominating over the former on large angular scales. Thus, both effects must explicitly be included to obtain sufficiently accurate predictions for stage IV lensing surveys. Reassuringly, our results agree accurately with other simulation results where available, supporting the promise of simulation modelling for precision cosmology far into the non-linear regime.\n",
      "42        An era of kination occurs when the Universe&#39;s energy density is dominated by a fast-rolling scalar field. <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">Dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> that is thermally produced during an era of kination requires larger-than-canonical annihilation cross sections to generate the observed <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> relic abundance. Furthermore, <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> density perturbations that enter the horizon during an era of kination grow linearly with the scale factor prior to radiation domination. We show how the resulting enhancement to the small-scale <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> power spectrum increases the microhalo abundance and boosts the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> annihilation rate. We then use gamma-ray observations to constrain thermal <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> production during kination. The annihilation boost factor depends on the minimum halo mass, which is determined by the small-scale cutoff in the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> power spectrum. Therefore, observational limits on the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> annihilation rate imply a minimum cutoff scale for a given <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> particle mass and kination scenario. For <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> that was once in thermal equilibrium with the Standard Model, this constraint establishes a maximum allowed kinetic decoupling temperature for the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>. This bound on the decoupling temperature implies that the growth of perturbations during kination cannot appreciably boost the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> annihilation rate if <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> was once in thermal equilibrium with the Standard Model.\n",
      "43        We present the measurement of total and stellar/<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> decomposed mass density profile around a sample of galaxy groups and clusters with dynamical masses derived from integral-field stellar kinematics from the MaNGA survey in Paper~I and weak lensing derived from the DECaLS imaging survey. Combining the two data sets enables accurate measurement of the radial density distribution from several kpc to Mpc scales. Intriguingly, we find that the excess surface density derived from stellar kinematics in the inner region cannot be explained by simply adding an NFW <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halo extrapolated from lensing measurement at a larger scale to a stellar mass component derived from the NASA-Sloan Atlas (NSA) catalog. We find that a good fit to both data sets requires a stellar mass normalization about 3 times higher than that derived from the NSA catalog, which would require an unrealistically too-heavy initial mass function for stellar mass estimation. If we keep the stellar mass normalization to that of the NSA catalog but allow a varying inner <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> density profile, we obtain an asymptotic slope of $γ_{\\rm gnfw}$= $1.82_{-0.25}^{+0.15}$, $γ_{\\rm gnfw}$= $1.48_{-0.41}^{+0.20}$ for the group bin and the cluster bin respectively, significantly steeper than the NFW case. We also compare the total mass inner density slopes with those from Illustris-TNG300 and find that the values from the simulation are lower than the observation by at least $3σ$ level.\n",
      "44        We present dynamical scaling relations, combined with the stellar population properties, for a subsample of about 6000 nearby galaxies with the most reliable dynamical models extracted from the full MaNGA sample of 10K galaxies. We show that the inclination-corrected mass plane (MP) for both early-type galaxies (ETGs) and late-type galaxies (LTGs), which links dynamical mass, projected half-light radius $R_{\\rm e}$, and the second stellar velocity moment $σ_{\\rm e}$ within $R_{\\rm e}$, satisfies the virial theorem and is even tighter than the uncorrected one. We find a clear parabolic relation between $\\lg(M/L)(&lt;R_{\\rm e})$, the total mass-to-light ratio within a sphere of radius $R_{\\rm e}$, and $\\lgσ_{\\rm e}$, with the $M/L$ increasing with $σ_{\\rm e}$ and for older stellar populations. However, the relation for ETGs is linear and the one for the youngest galaxies is constant. We confirm and improve the relation between average logarithmic total density slopes $γ_{_{\\rm T}}$ and $σ_{\\rm e}$: $γ_{_{\\rm T}}$ become steeper with increasing $σ_{\\rm e}$ until $\\lg(σ_{\\rm e}/{\\rm km\\,s^{-1}})\\approx 2.2$ and then remain constant around $γ_{_{\\rm T}}\\approx -2.2$. The $γ_{_{\\rm T}}-σ_{\\rm e}$ variation is larger for LTGs than ETGs. At fixed $σ_{\\rm e}$ the total density profiles steepen with galaxy age and for ETGs. We find generally low <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> fractions, median $f_{\\rm DM}(&lt;R_{\\rm e})=8$ per cent, within a sphere of radius $R_{\\rm e}$. However, we find that $f_{\\rm DM}(&lt;R_{\\rm e})$ depends on $σ_{\\rm e}$ better than stellar mass: <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> increases to a median $f_{\\rm DM}=33$ percent for galaxies with $σ_{\\rm e}\\lesssim100{\\rm km\\,s^{-1}}$. The increased $f_{\\rm DM}(&lt;R_{\\rm e})$ at low $σ_{\\rm e}$ explains the parabolic $\\lg(M/L)(&lt;R_{\\rm e})-\\lgσ_{\\rm e}$ relation.\n",
      "45        We analyze the global stellar population, radial gradients and non-parametric star formation history of $\\sim 10$K galaxies from the MaNGA Survey final data release 17 (DR17), based on stellar population synthesis and full-spectrum fitting, and relate them with dynamical properties of galaxies. We confirm that stellar population correlates with stellar velocity dispersion $σ_{\\rm e}$ better than with stellar mass $M_{\\ast}$, but also find that younger galaxies are more metal-poor at fixed $σ_{\\rm e}$. Stellar age, metallicity, and mass-to-light ratio $M_{\\ast}/L$ all decrease with galaxy rotation, while radial gradients become more negative (i.e., younger, more metal-poor, and lower $M_{\\ast}/L$ in the outskirts). The trend between metallicity gradients and rotation reverses for slow rotators, which stand out for their more negative metallicity gradients than faster-rotating galaxies. We highlight a population of massive disk galaxies on the green valley, on the $(σ_{\\rm e},\\rm Age)$ plane, that show steep negative age and metallicity gradients, consistent with their old central bulges surrounded by young star-forming disks and metal-poor gas accretion. Galaxies with high $σ_{\\rm e}$, steep total mass-density slope, low <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> fraction, high $M_{\\ast}/L$, and high metallicity have the highest star-formation rate at earlier times, and are currently quenched. We discover a population of low-mass star-forming galaxies with low rotation but physically distinct from the massive slow rotators. A catalogue of the population properties is provided publicly.\n",
      "46        This is the first paper in our series on the combined analysis of the Dynamics and stellar Population (DynPop) for the MaNGA survey in the final SDSS Data Release 17 (DR17). Here we present a catalogue of dynamically-determined quantities for over 10000 nearby galaxies based on integral-field stellar kinematics from the MaNGA survey. The dynamical properties are extracted using the axisymmetric Jeans Anisotropic Modelling (JAM) method, which was previously shown to be the most accurate for this kind of study. We assess systematic uncertainties using eight dynamical models with different assumptions. We use two orientations of the velocity ellipsoid: either cylindrically-aligned JAM$_{\\rm cyl}$ or spherically-aligned JAM$_{\\rm sph}$. We also make four assumptions for the models&#39; <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> vs. luminous <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> distributions: (1) mass-follows-light, (2) free NFW <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> halo, (3) cosmologically-constrained NFW halo, (4) generalized NFW <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> halo, i.e. with free inner slope. In this catalogue, we provide the quantities related to the mass distributions (e.g. the density slopes and enclosed mass within a sphere of a given radius for total mass, stellar mass, and <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> mass components). We also provide the complete models which can be used to compute the full luminous and mass distribution of each galaxy. Additionally, we visually assess the qualities of the models to help with model selections. We estimate the observed scatter in the measured quantities which decreases as expected with improvements in quality. For the best data quality, we find a remarkable consistency of measured quantities between different models, highlighting the robustness of the results.\n",
      "47        What is the highest energy at which gravitons can be observed? We address this question by studying graviton-to-photon conversion - the inverse-Gertsenshtein effect - in the magnetic field of the Milky Way. We find that above $\\sim 1~\\mbox{PeV}$ the effective photon mass grows large enough to quench the conversion rate. The induced photon flux is comparable to the sensitivity of LHAASO to a diffuse $γ$-ray background, but only for graviton abundances of order $Ω_{\\text{gw}} h^2_0 \\sim 1$. In the future, owing to a better understanding of $γ$-ray backgrounds, larger effective areas and longer observation times, sub-PeV shimmering gravitons with a realistic abundance of $Ω_{\\text{gw}} h^2_0 \\sim 0.01$ could be detected. We show that this is achieved in a cosmologically-motivated scenario of post-recombination superheavy <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> decay. Therefore, the sub-PeV range might be the ultimate energy frontier at which gravitons can be observed.\n",
      "48        The relation between the total mass contained in the globular clusters of a galaxy and the mass of its <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halo has been found observationally to be nearly linear over five decades of mass. However, the high-mass end of this relation is not well determined from previous data and shows large scatter. We analyze the globular cluster systems (GCSs) of a homogeneous sample of 11 brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) through DOLPHOT photometry of their deep Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images in the F814W filter. We standardize the definition of $M_{GCS}$, the total GCS mass, by using the GC total population within a limiting radius of $0.1 R_{virial}$, while the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span>-<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halo mass $M_h$ is determined from the weak-lensing calibration of $M_h$ versus $M_{bary}$. When these 11 BCGs are added to the previously studied homogeneous catalogue of Virgo member galaxies, a total value for $η= M_{GCS}/M_h$ is found to be $(3.0\\pm1.8_{internal})\\times10^{-5}$, slightly higher than previous estimates but with much reduced uncertainty. Perhaps more importantly, the results suggest that the relation continues to have a near-linear shape at the highest galaxy masses, strongly reinforcing the conclusion that accreted GCs make a major contribution to the GC populations at high galaxy mass.\n",
      "49        We introduce an analytic surface density profile for <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halos that accurately reproduces the structure of simulated halos of mass $M_{\\rm vir} = 10^{7-11}\\ M_\\odot$, making it useful for modeling line-of-sight perturbers in strong gravitational lensing models. The two-parameter function has an analytic deflection potential and is more accurate than the projected Navarro, Frenk &amp; White (NFW) profile commonly adopted at this mass scale for perturbers, especially at the small radii of most relevant for lensing perturbations. Using a characteristic radius, $R_{-1}$, where the log slope of surface density is equal to $-1$, and an associated surface density, $Σ_{-1}$, we can represent the expected lensing signal from line-of-sight halos statistically, for an ensemble of halo orientations, using a distribution of {\\em projected concentration} parameters, $\\mathcal{C}_{\\rm vir} := r_{\\rm vir}/ R_{-1}$. Though an individual halo can have a projected concentration that varies with orientation with respect to the observer, the range of projected concentrations correlates with the usual three-dimensional halo concentration in a way that enables ease of use.\n",
      "50        Axions and axion-like particles (ALPs) are a prominent <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> candidate, drawing motivation in part from the axiverse of string theory. Axion-like particles can also arise as composite degrees of freedom of a <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> sector, for example, as <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> pions in <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> Quantum Chromo-Dynamics. In a <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> Standard Model (SM) wherein all 6 quark flavors are light while the photon is massive, one finds a rich low-energy spectrum of stable and ultralight particles, in the form of neutral and charged <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> scalars, and complex neutral scalars analogous to the SM kaon, with mass splittings determined by the mass and charge of the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> quarks. The model finds a natural portal to the visible sector via kinetic coupling of the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> and visible photons, and consequent millicharges for <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>. The <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> can be a mixture of all these ultralight bosonic degrees of freedom, and exhibit both parity-even and parity-odd interactions, making the theory testable at a wide variety of experiments.

      "51        The most luminous quasars at $z &gt; 6$ are suspected to be both highly clustered and reside in the most massive <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halos in the early Universe, making them prime targets to search for galaxy overdensities and/or protoclusters. We search for Lyman-break dropout-selected galaxies using HST WFC3/ACS broadband imaging in the fields of three $6 &lt; z &lt; 7$ quasars, as well as their simultaneously observed coordinated-parallel fields, and constrain their photometric redshifts using EAZY. One field, J0305-3150, shows a volume density 10$\\times$ higher than the blank-field UV luminosity function (UVLF) at M$_{UV} &lt; -20$, with tentative evidence of a 3$σ$ overdensity in its parallel field located 15 cMpc away. Another field, J2054-0005, shows an angular overdensity within 500 ckpc from the quasar but still consistent with UVLF predictions within 3$σ$, while the last field, J2348-3054, shows no enhancement. We discuss methods for reducing uncertainty in overdensity measurements when using photometric selection and show that we can robustly select LBGs consistent with being physically associated with the quasar, corroborated by existing JWST/NIRCam WFSS data in the J0305 field. Even accounting for incompleteness, the overdensities in J0305 and J2054 are higher for brighter galaxies at short angular separations, suggesting preferential enhancement of more massive galaxies in the immediate vicinity of the quasar. Finally, we compare the LBG population with previously-identified [CII] and mm-continuum companions; the LBG overdensities are not accompanied by an enhanced number of dusty galaxies, suggesting that the overdense quasar fields are not in the bursty star-forming phase sometimes seen in high-redshift protoclusters.\n"

The effects of DM on NS properties, including the mass-radius relation, the moment of inertia, and tidal deformability, are calculated by varying its fraction. The study found that the EOS becomes softer with increasing DM momentum, and the DM has marginal effects on nuclear <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> properties, except for the EOSs and binding energy per particle. The study also calculated the properties of isolated, static, and rotating DM admixed NS and found that the DM has significant effects on both static and rotating NS. We have also observed that a tiny amount of DM can accumulate inside the NS, and more amount of it makes the NS unstable. The study also suggests that the secondary component might be a NS with DM content if the underlying nuclear EOS is sufficiently stiff. The $f$-mode oscillations of the DM admixed hyperon stars are calculated and found that there exist a correlation between canonical $f$-mode frequency and the dimensionless tidal deformability parameter ($Λ_{1.4}$) and we have put a constraint on $f$-mode frequency using GW170817 data. Finally, we have calculated the DM admixed binary NS properties and found that the binary system becomes less deformed and sustains more time in its inspiral phases with the addition of DM. Therefore, we suggest that one can take DM inside the compact objects while modeling the inspiral waveforms for the BNS systems.\n",
      "3        Radiative emissions from electrons and positrons generated by <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> (DM) annihilation or decay are one of the most investigated signals in indirect searches of WIMPs. Ideal targets must have large ratio of DM to baryonic <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>. However, such ``<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span>&#39;&#39; systems have a poorly known level of magnetic turbulence, which determines the residence time of the electrons and positrons and therefore also the strength of the expected signal. This typically leads to significant uncertainties in the derived DM bounds. In a novel approach, we compute the self-confinement of the DM-induced electrons and positrons. Indeed, they themselves generate irregularities in the magnetic field, thus setting a lower limit on the presence of the magnetic turbulence. We specifically apply this approach to dwarf spheroidal galaxies. Finally, by comparing the expected synchrotron emission with radio data from the direction of the Draco galaxy collected at the Giant Metre Radio Telescope, we show that the proposed approach can be used to set robust and competitive bounds on WIMP DM.\n",
      "4        The particle origin of <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> (DM) is still one of the main puzzles in modern physics. One of the most promising search strategy to detect DM at laboratories is through the indirect search of cosmic particles that are produced from DM annihilation in space. In particular, the flux of cosmic positrons has been measured with high precision by the AMS-02 experiment demonstrating that an excess above 10 GeV, with respect to the secondary production, is present. We study in this paper the possible DM origin of the positron excess finding the values of the DM mass $M$ and annihilation cross section $\\langle σv \\rangle$ that are needed to fit high-energy positron data. In particular, we find that for DM annihilating into $b\\bar{b}$ it is required to have $M=43$ TeV and $\\langle σv \\rangle = 10^{-21}$ cm$^3$/s while for $τ^+τ^-$ $M=2$ TeV and $\\langle σv \\rangle = 3\\times 10^{-23}$ cm$^3$/s. If DM produce positrons, they are expected to generate gamma rays from the center of the Milky Way and around dwarf galaxy satellites of the Galaxy. We thus combine the values for the DM mass and annihilation cross section obtained with the fit to AMS-02 positron data with the upper limits derived with the non-detection of $γ$ rays with HESS in the direction of the Galactic center and Fermi-LAT for the combined analysis of dwarf galaxies. The main result of the paper is that only DM annihilating into $μ^+ μ^-$ with a mass around 500 GeV and $\\langle σv \\rangle = 4\\times 10^{-24}$ cm$^3$/s can fit AMS-02 data and be compatible with the upper limits found with $γ$ rays. As for the $τ^+ τ^-$ ($b\\bar{b}$) channel, DM can contribute at most at a few tens $\\%$ (a few \\%) level.\n",

      "6        Numerous observations suggest that there exist undiscovered beyond-the-Standard-Model particles and fields. Because of their unknown nature, these exotic particles and fields could interact with Standard Model particles in many different ways and assume a variety of possible configurations. Here we present an overview of the Global Network of Optical Magnetometers for Exotic physics searches (GNOME), our ongoing experimental program designed to test a wide range of exotic physics scenarios. The GNOME experiment utilizes a worldwide network of shielded atomic magnetometers (and, more recently, comagnetometers) to search for spatially and temporally correlated signals due to torques on atomic spins from exotic fields of astrophysical origin.

      "7        Recent observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) are yielding tantalizing hints of an early population of massive, bright galaxies at $z &gt; 10$, with Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) observations indicating significant dust masses in place as early as $z\\sim 7$. To understand the implications of these observations, we use the DELPHI semi-analytic model that jointly tracks the assembly of <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halos and their constituent baryons, including the key processes of dust enrichment. Our model employs only two redshift- and mass-independent free parameters that are tuned against all available galaxy data at $z \\sim 5-9$ before it is used to make predictions up to $z \\sim 20$. Our key results are: (1) the model progressively under-predicts the observed ultraviolet luminosity function (UV LF) at $z &gt; 12$; observations at $z&gt;16$ lie close to, or even above, a &#34;maximal&#34; model where all available gas is turned into stars; (2) UV selection would miss 34% of the star formation rate density at $z \\sim 5$, decreasing to 17% by $z \\sim 10$ for bright galaxies with $\\rm{M_{UV}} &lt; -19$; (3) the dust mass ($M_d$) evolves with the stellar mass ($M_*$) and redshift as $\\log(M_d) = 1.194\\log(M_*) + 0.0975z - 5.433$; (4) the escape fraction of UV photons ($f_{\\rm esc}^{\\rm UV}$) decreases with increasing mass and star formation rate. At $z \\sim 7$, $f_{\\rm esc}^{\\rm UV} \\sim 0.8~(0.1)$ for $M_* \\sim 10^9~ (10^{11}) \\, M_\\odot$ galaxies; (5) the dust temperature increases with stellar mass, ranging between $30-33$ K for $M_* \\sim 10^{9-11}M_\\odot$ galaxies at $z \\sim 7$. Finally, we predict the far infrared (FIR) LF at $z \\sim 5-20$, testable with ALMA observations, and caution that spectroscopic redshifts and dust masses must be pinned down before invoking unphysical extrema in galaxy formation models.\n",

We compute how this picture is modified at next-to-leading order (NLO) with the goal of assigning a reliable theory uncertainty to the freeze-out predictions. We explicitly compute NLO corrections in a simple model with abelian gauge interactions and provide an estimate of the theoretical uncertainty for the thermal masses of heavy electroweak $n$-plets. Along the way, we clarify the regularization and matching procedure necessary to deal with singular potentials in quantum mechanics with a calculable relativistic UV completion.\n",
      "9        We provide an algorithm for evolving general spin-$s$ Gross-Pitaevskii / non-linear Schrödinger systems carrying a variety of interactions, where the $2s+1$ components of the `spinor&#39; field represent the different spin-multiplicity states. We consider many nonrelativistic interactions up to quartic order in the Schrödinger field (both short and long-range, and spin-dependent and spin-independent interactions), including explicit spin-orbit couplings. The algorithm allows for spatially varying external and/or self-generated vector potentials that couple to the spin density of the field. Our work can be used for scenarios ranging from laboratory systems such as spinor Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs), to cosmological/astrophysical systems such as self-interacting bosonic <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>. As examples, we provide results for two different setups of spin-$1$ BECs that employ a varying magnetic field and spin-orbit coupling, respectively, and also collisions of spin-$1$ solitons in <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>. Our symplectic algorithm is second-order accurate in time, and is extensible to the known higher-order accurate methods.\n",
      "10        We discuss the production of primordial black holes in an early <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> dominated era, which typically takes place in string inspired early universe cosmological models. In particular, we consider a pre-big bang scenario (extending previous results regarding formation in the radiation dominated era) where the enhancement of curvature perturbations is induced by a variation of the sound-speed parameter c_s during the string phase of high-curvature inflation. After imposing all relevant observational constraints, we find that the considered class of models is compatible with the production of a large amount of primordial black holes, in the mass range relevant to <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>, only for a small range of the parameters space. On the other hand, we find that a huge production of light primordial black holes may occur both in such <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> dominated era and in the radiation dominated one.\n",
      "11        We explore an extension of the standard $Λ$CDM model by including an interaction between neutrinos and <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>, and making use of the ground based telescope data of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT). An indication for a non-zero coupling between <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> and neutrinos (both assuming a temperature independent and $T^2$ dependent cross-section) is obtained at the 1$σ$ level coming from the ACT CMB data alone and when combined with the Planck CMB and Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) measurements. This result is confirmed by both fixing the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom in the early Universe to the Standard Model value of $N_{\\rm eff}=3.044$, and allowing $N_{\\rm eff}$ to be a free cosmological parameter. Furthermore, when performing a Bayesian model comparison, the interacting $ν$DM (+$N_{\\rm eff}$) scenario is mostly preferred over a baseline $Λ$CDM (+$N_{\\rm eff}$) cosmology. The preferred value is then used as a benchmark and the potential implications of <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter&#39;s</span> interaction with a sterile neutrino are discussed.\n",
      "12        We present an innovative approach to constraining the non-cold <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> model using a convolutional neural network (CNN). We perform a suite of hydrodynamic simulations with varying <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> particle masses and generate mock 21cm radio intensity maps to trace the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> distribution. Our proposed method complements the traditional power spectrum analysis. We compare our CNN classification results with those from the power spectrum of the differential brightness temperature map of 21cm radiation, and find that the CNN outperforms the latter. Moreover, we investigate the impact of baryonic physics on the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> model constraint, including star formation, self-shielding of HI gas, and UV background model. We find that these effects may introduce some contamination in the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> constraint, but they are insignificant when compared to the realistic system noise of the SKA instruments.\n",
      "13        The <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> power spectrum has been strongly constrained by astronomical measurements at large scales, but only weakly at small scales. Compared with the standard scenario, the deviation of the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> power spectrum at small scales has influence on the cosmological structure formation, e.g., the comoving number density of <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halos. The thermal history of the intergalactic medium (IGM) can be changed if <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> is made of weakly interacting massive particles and can annihilate into standard model particles. The changes of the evolution of IGM could leave imprints on the relevant astronomical observations. Taking into account the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> annihilation, we investigate the impact of the deviation of <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> power spectrum at small scales on the global 21-cm signal. In view of the measurements of the global 21-cm signal by the EDGES experiment, we explore the allowed parameter space of $m_s$, which describes the degree of deviation, by requiring the differential brightness temperature of the global 21-cm signal $δT_{21} \\le -50~\\rm mK$ at redshift $z=17$.\n",
      "14        Using Low Brightness Surface Galaxies (LBSG) rotational curves we inferred the free parameters of $\\ell$-boson stars as a <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> component. The $\\ell$-boson stars are numerical solutions to the non-relativistic limit of the Einstein-Klein-Gordon system, the Schrödinger-Poisson (SP) system. These solutions are parametrized by an angular momentum number $\\ell = (N-1)/2$ and an excitation number $n$. We perform a bayesian analysis by modifying the SimpleMC code to perform the parameter inference, for the cases with $\\ell = 0$, $\\ell = 1$ and multistates of $\\ell$-boson stars. We used the Akaike information criterion (AIC), Bayesian information criterion and the Bayes factor to compare the excited state ($\\ell$=1) and the multistate case with the ground state ($\\ell$=0) as the base model due to its simplicity. We found that the data in most galaxies in the sample favours the multistates case and that the scalar field mass tends to be slightly bigger than the ground state case.\n",
      "15        A long-standing observed curiosity of globular clusters (GCs) has been that both the number and total mass of GCs in a galaxy are linearly correlated with the galaxy&#39;s virial mass, whereas its stellar component shows no such linear correlation. This work expands on an empirical model for the numbers and ages of GCs in galaxies presented by Valenzuela et al. (2021) that is consistent with recent observational data from massive elliptical galaxies down to the dwarf galaxy regime. Applying the model to simulations, GC numbers are shown to be excellent tracers for the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> (DM) virial mass, even when distinct formation mechanisms are employed for blue and red GCs. Furthermore, the amount of DM smooth accretion is encoded in the GC abundances, therefore providing a measure for an otherwise nearly untraceable component of the formation history of galaxies.\n",
      "16        We analytically solve the problem of Bose star growth in the bath of gravitationally interacting particles. We find that after nucleation of this object, the bath is described by a self-similar solution of the kinetic equation, which is an attractor. Together with the conservation laws, this fixes mass evolution of the Bose star. Our results explain slowdown of the star growth at a certain &#34;core-halo&#34; mass, but also predict formation of the heavier and lighter objects in magistral <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> models.\n",
      "17        <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">Dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> subhaloes are key for the predictions of simulations of structure formation, but their existence frequently ends prematurely due to two technical issues, namely numerical disruption in N-body simulations and halo finders failing to identify them. Here we focus on the second issue, using the phase-space friends-of-friends halo finder ROCKSTAR as a benchmark (though we expect our results to translate to comparable codes). We confirm that the most prominent cause for losing track of subhaloes is tidal distortion rather than a low number of particles. As a solution, we present a flexible post-processing algorithm that tracks all subhalo particles over time, computes subhalo positions and masses based on those particles, and progressively removes stripped <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>. If a subhalo is lost by the halo finder, this algorithm keeps tracking its so-called ghost until it has almost no particles left or has truly merged with its host. We apply this technique to a large suite of N-body simulations and restore lost subhaloes to the halo catalogues, which has a dramatic effect on key summary statistics of large-scale structure. Specifically, the subhalo mass function increases by about 50% and the halo correlation function increases by a factor of two at small scales. While these quantitative results are somewhat specific to our algorithm, they demonstrate that particle tracking is a promising way to reliably follow haloes and reduce the need for orphan models. Our algorithm and augmented halo catalogues are publicly available.\n",
      "18        Ultralight bosons are predicted in many extensions to the Standard Model and are popular <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> candidates. The black hole superradiance mechanism allows for these particles to be probed using only their gravitational interaction. In this scenario, an ultralight boson cloud may form spontaneously around a spinning black hole and extract a non-negligible fraction of the black hole&#39;s mass. These oscillating clouds produce quasi-monochromatic, long-duration gravitational waves that may be detectable by ground-based or space-based gravitational wave detectors. We discuss the capability of a new long-duration signal tracking method, based on a hidden Markov model, to detect gravitational wave signals generated by ultralight vector boson clouds, including cases where the signal frequency evolution timescale is much shorter than that of a typical continuous wave signal. We quantify the detection horizon distances for vector boson clouds with current- and next-generation ground-based detectors. We demonstrate that vector clouds hosted by black holes with mass $\\gtrsim 60 M_{\\odot}$ and spin $\\gtrsim 0.6$ are within the reach of current-generation detectors up to a luminosity distance of $\\sim 1$ Gpc. This search method enables one to target vector boson clouds around remnant black holes from compact binary mergers detected by gravitational-wave detectors. We discuss the impact of the sky localization of the merger events and demonstrate that a typical remnant black hole reasonably well-localized by the current generation detector network is accessible in a follow-up search.\n",
      "19        Lithium-drifted silicon [Si(Li)] has been used for decades as an ionizing radiation detector in nuclear, particle, and astrophysical experiments, though such detectors have frequently been limited to small sizes (few cm$^2$) and cryogenic operating temperatures. The 10-cm-diameter Si(Li) detectors developed for the General Antiparticle Spectrometer (GAPS) balloon-borne <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> experiment are novel particularly for their requirements of low cost, large sensitive area (~10 m$^2$ for the full 1440-detector array), high temperatures (near -40$\\,^\\circ$C), and energy resolution below 4 keV FWHM for 20--100-keV x-rays. Previous works have discussed the manufacturing, passivation, and small-scale testing of prototype GAPS Si(Li) detectors. Here we show for the first time the results from detailed characterization of over 1100 flight detectors, illustrating the consistent intrinsic low-noise performance of a large sample of GAPS detectors. This work demonstrates the feasibility of large-area and low-cost Si(Li) detector arrays for next-generation astrophysics and nuclear physics applications.\n",

The boosted <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">Dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">Matter</span> flux at the edge of the Earth&#39;s atmosphere is expected to be pointing to the Galactic Center, with a flux 15 to 20 times larger than in the transverse direction.\n",
      "21        We investigate the reach of future gravitational wave (GW) detectors in probing inflaton couplings with visible sector particles that can either be bosonic or fermionic in nature. Assuming reheating takes place through perturbative quantum production from vacuum in presence of classical inflaton background field, we find that the spectral energy density of the primordial GW generated during inflation becomes sensitive to inflaton-<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> coupling. We conclude, obeying bounds from Big Bang Nucleosysthesis and Cosmic Microwave Background, that, e.g., inflaton-scalar couplings of the order of $\\sim\\mathcal{O}(10^{-20})$ GeV fall within the sensitivity range of several proposed GW detector facilities. However, this prediction is sensitive to the size of the inflationary scale, nature of the inflaton-<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> interaction and shape of the potential during reheating. Having found the time-dependent effective inflaton decay width, we also discuss its implications for <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> (DM) production from the thermal plasma via UV freeze-in during reheating. It is shown, that one can reproduce the observed DM abundance for its mass up to several PeVs, depending on the dimension of the operator connecting DM with the thermal bath and the associated scale of the UV physics. Thus we promote primordial GW to observables sensitive to feebly coupled inflaton, which is very challenging if not impossible to test in conventional particle physics laboratories or astrophysical measurements.\n",
      "22        We argue that demanding a consistent cosmological history, including the absence of domain walls and strongly interacting relics at the Peccei-Quinn scale, singles out two concrete realizations of hadronic QCD axions as viable <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> models. These realizations generally feature flavor-violating axion couplings to Standard Model quarks that are unsuppressed at low energies. As a consequence, experiments looking for flavor-violating hadronic processes involving the axion can be sensitive probes of QCD axion <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> models. In particular, we show that the NA62 and KOTO experiments could detect the $K\\rightarrowπ+ a$ decay for axions consistent with the observed <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> abundance via the post-inflationary misalignment mechanism.\n",
      "23        The mean <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> density within the turnaround radius, which is the boundary that separates a nonexpanding structure from the Hubble flow, was recently proposed as a novel cosmological probe. According to the spherical collapse model, the evolution with cosmic time of this turnaround density, $\\rm ρ_{ta}(z)$, can be used to determine both $\\rm Ω_m$ and $Ω_Λ$, independently of any other currently used probe. The properties of $\\rm ρ_{ta}$ predicted by the spherical collapse model were also shown to persist in the presence of full three-dimensional effects in $\\rm Λ$CDM N-body cosmological simulations when considering galaxy clusters at the present time, $z=0$. However, a small offset was discovered between the spherical-collapse prediction of the value of $ρ_{ta}$ at $z=0$ and its value measured in simulations. In this letter, we explore whether this offset evolves with cosmic time; whether it differs in different cosmologies; whether its origin can be confidently identified; and whether it can be corrected. We found that the offset does evolve slightly with redshift, and that it correlates strongly with the deviation from spherical symmetry of the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halo distribution inside and outside of the turnaround radius. We used an appropriate metric to quantify deviations in the environment of a structure from spherical symmetry. We found that using this metric, we can construct a sphericity-selected sample of halos for which the offset of $ρ_{ta}$ from the spherical collapse prediction is zero, independently of redshift and cosmology. We found that a sphericity-selected halo sample allows us to recover the simulated cosmology, and we conclude that the turnaround density evolution indeed encodes the cosmology in N-body simulations.\n",
      "24        We present a new suite of over 1,500 cosmological N-body simulations with varied Warm <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">Dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">Matter</span> (WDM) models ranging from 2.5 to 30 keV. We use these simulations to train Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to infer WDM particle masses from images of DM field data. Our fiducial setup can make accurate predictions of the WDM particle mass up to 7.5 keV at a 95% confidence level from small maps that cover an area of (25 h$^{-1}$ Mpc)$^2$. We vary the image resolution, simulation resolution, redshift, and cosmology of our fiducial setup to better understand how our model is making predictions. Using these variations, we find that our models are most dependent on simulation resolution, minimally dependent on image resolution, not systematically dependent on redshift, and robust to varied cosmologies. We also find that an important feature to distinguish between WDM models is present with a linear size between 100 and 200 h$^{-1}$ kpc. We compare our fiducial model to one trained on the power spectrum alone and find that our field-level model can make 2x more precise predictions and can make accurate predictions to 2x as massive WDM particle masses when used on the same data. Overall, we find that the field-level data can be used to accurately differentiate between WDM models and contain more information than is captured by the power spectrum. This technique can be extended to more complex DM models and opens up new opportunities to explore alternative DM models in a cosmological environment.\n",
      "25        The properties of globular clusters (GCs) contain valuable information of their host galaxies and <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span>-<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halos. In the remarkable example of ultra-diffuse galaxy, NGC5846-UDG1, the GC population exhibits strong radial mass segregation, indicative of dynamical-friction-driven orbital decay, which opens the possibility of using imaging data alone to constrain the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span>-<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> content of the galaxy. To explore this possibility, we develop a semi-analytical model of GC evolution, which starts from the initial mass function, the initial structure-mass relation, and the initial spatial distribution of the GC progenitors, and follows the effects of dynamical friction, tidal evolution, and two-body relaxation. Using Markov Chain Monte Carlo, we forward-model the GCs in a NGC5846-UDG1-like potential to match the observed GC mass, size, and spatial distributions, and to constrain the profile of the host halo and the origin of the GCs. We find that, with the assumptions of zero mass segregation when the star clusters were born, NGC5846-UDG1 is <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span>-<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> poor compared to what is expected from stellar-to-halo-mass relations, and its halo concentration is low, irrespective of having a cuspy or a cored halo profile. Its GC population has an initial spatial distribution more extended than the smooth stellar distribution. We discuss the results in the context of scaling laws of galaxy-halo connections, and warn against naively using the GC-abundance-halo-mass relation to infer the halo mass of UDGs. Our model is generally applicable to GC-rich dwarf galaxies, and is publicly available at https://github.com/JiangFangzhou/GCevo.\n",
      "26        The Epoch of Reionization (EoR) neutral Hydrogen (HI) 21-cm signal evolves significantly along the line-of-sight (LoS) due to the light-cone (LC) effect. It is important to accurately incorporate this in simulations in order to correctly interpret the signal. 21-cm LC simulations are typically produced by stitching together slices from a finite number $(N_{\\rm RS})$ of &#39;&#39;reionization snapshot&#39;&#39;, each corresponding to a different stage of reionization. In this paper, we have quantified the errors in the 21-cm LC simulation due to the finite value of $N_{\\rm RS}$. We show that this can introduce large discontinuities $(&gt; 200 \\%)$ at the stitching boundaries when $N_{\\rm RS}$ is small $(= 2,4)$ and the mean neutral fraction jumps by $δ\\bar{x}_{\\rm HI} = 0.2,0.1$ respectively at the stitching boundaries. This drops to $17 \\%$ for $N_{\\rm RS} = 13$ where $δ\\bar{x}_{\\rm HI}=0.02$. We present and also validate a method for mitigating this error by increasing $N_{\\rm RS}$ without a proportional increase in the computational costs which are mainly incurred in generating the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> and halo density fields. Our method generates these fields only at a few redshifts, and interpolates them to generate reionization snapshots at closely spaced redshifts. We use this to generate 21-cm LC simulations with $N_{\\rm RS} = 26,51,101$ and $201$, and show that the errors go down as $N_{\\rm RS}^{-1}$.\n",
      "27        The advent of gravitational wave astronomy has seen a huge influx of new predictions for potential discoveries of beyond the Standard Model fields. The coupling of all fundamental fields to gravity, together with its dominance on large scales, makes gravitational physics a rich laboratory to study fundamental physics. This holds especially true for the search for the elusive <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> photon, a promising <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> candidate. The <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> photon is predicted to generate instabilities in a rotating black hole spacetime, birthing a macroscopic Bose-Einstein condensate. These condensates can especially form around super massive black holes, modifying the dynamical inspiralling process. This then opens another window to leverage future space-borne gravitational wave antennas to join the hunt for the elusive <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> particle. This study builds a preliminary model for the gravitational waveform emitted by such a dressed extreme mass-ratio inspiral. Comparing these waveforms to the vacuum scenario allows projections to the potential constrainability on the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> photon mass by space-borne gravitational wave antennas. The superradiant instability of a massive vector field on a Kerr background is calculated and the modification to the dynamics of an inspiralling solar mass-scale compact object is determined with approximations on the backreaction effect of the cloud on the compact object. The end result is the projection that the LISA mission should be able to constrain the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> photon mass using extreme mass ratio inspirals in the range $[1.8 \\times 10^{-17}, 4.47 \\times 10^{-16}]$ eV.\n",
      "28        Recent observations made by the JWST have revealed a number of massive galaxies at high redshift ($z$). The presence of these galaxies appears at odds with the current $Λ$CDM cosmology. Here we investigate the possibility of alleviating the tension by incorporating uncertainties from three sources in counting massive galaxies at high $z$: cosmic variance, error in stellar mass estimate, and contribution by backsplash. We find that each of the sources can significantly increase the cumulative stellar mass density $ρ_*(&gt;M_*)$ at the high-mass end, and the combination of them can boost the density by more than one order of magnitude. Assuming a star formation efficiency of $ε_* \\sim 0.5$, cosmic variance alone can reduce the tension to $2σ$ level, except the most massive galaxy at $z=8$. Including in addition a lognormal dispersion with a width of 0.3 dex in the stellar mass can bring the observed stellar mass density at $z \\sim 7 - 10$ to the $2σ$ range of the cosmic variance. The tension is completely eliminated when gas stripped from backsplash halos is also taken into account. Our results highlight the importance of fully modeling uncertainties when interpreting observational data of rare objects. We use the constrained simulation, ELUCID, to investigate the descendants of high $z$ massive galaxies. We find that a significant portion of these galaxies end up in massive halos with mass $M_{\\rm halo} &gt; 10^{13} h^{-1}M_\\odot $ at $z=0$. A large fraction of central galaxies in $M_{\\rm halo} \\geqslant 10^{14.5} h^{-1}M_\\odot$ halos today are predicted to contain significant amounts of ancient stars formed in massive galaxies at $z\\sim 8$. This prediction can be tested by studying the structure and stellar population of central galaxies in present-day massive clusters.\n",
      "29        Within the $Λ$CDM cosmology, <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> haloes are comprised of both a smooth component and a population of smaller, gravitationally bound subhaloes. These components are often treated as a single halo when halo properties, such as density profiles, are extracted from simulations. Recent work has shown that density profiles change substantially when subhalo mass is excluded. In this paper, we expand on this result by analysing the change in three specific host halo properties -- concentration ($c_{\\rm{NFW}}$), spin ($λ_{\\rm Bullock}$), and shape ($c/a$), -- when calculated only from the smooth component of the halo. This analysis is performed on both Milky Way-mass haloes and cluster-mass haloes in high-resolution, zoom-in, $N$-body simulations. We find that when subhaloes are excluded the median value of (1) $c_{\\rm{NFW}}$ is enhanced by $\\approx 38 \\pm 12\\%$ and $\\approx 88 \\pm 7.7\\%$ for Milky Way mass ($10^{12.1}\\,\\text{M}_\\odot$) and cluster mass ($10^{14.8}\\,\\text{M}_\\odot$) haloes respectively, (2) $λ_{\\rm Bullock}$ is reduced for Milky Way mass by $\\approx 16 \\pm 6.8\\%$ and cluster mass haloes by $\\approx 32 \\pm 8.9\\%$. Additionally, with the removal of subhaloes, cluster mass haloes tend to become more spherical as the ratio of minor-to-major axis, $c/a$, increases by $\\approx 12 \\pm 4\\%$, whereas Milky Way mass haloes remain approximately the same shape with $c/a$ changed by $\\approx 1.2 \\pm 5.6\\%$. The fractional change of each of these properties depends primarily on the amount of mass that is removed from the halo system and, to a lesser extent, mass accretion history. Our findings demonstrate that the properties of the smooth components of <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> haloes are biased relative to the total mass of the halo including subhaloes.\n",
      "30        In order to test active galactic nucleus (AGN) unification and evolutionary models, we measured the AGN clustering properties as a function of AGN obscuration defined in terms of hydrogen column density, $N_{\\rm H}$. In addition to measuring the clustering of unobscured ($N_{\\rm H} &lt; 10^{22}\\,{\\rm cm}^{-2}$) and moderately obscured ($10^{22} \\leq N_{\\rm H} &lt; 10^{23.5}$) AGNs, we also targeted highly obscured sources ($N_{\\rm H}\\geq 10^{23.5}$) up to redshifts of $z=3$. We have compiled one of the largest samples of X-ray-selected AGNs from a total of eight deep XMM/Chandra surveys. We measured the clustering as a function of both AGN obscuration and redshift using the projected two-point correlation function, $w_{\\rm p}(r_{\\rm p})$. We modeled the large-scale clustering signal, measured the AGN bias, $b(z, N_{\\rm H})$, and interpreted it in terms of the typical AGN host <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halo, $M_{\\rm halo}(z, N_{\\rm H}$). We find no significant dependence of AGN clustering on obscuration, suggesting similar typical masses of the hosting halos as a function of $N_{\\rm H}$. This result matches expectations of AGN unification models, in which AGN obscuration depends mainly on the viewing angle of the obscuring torus. We measured, for the first time, the clustering of highly obscured AGNs and find that these objects reside in halos with typical mass $\\log M_{\\rm halo} = 12.98_{-0.22}^{+0.17} [h^{-1} M_\\odot]$ ($12.28_{-0.19}^{+0.13}$) at low $z \\sim 0.7$ (high $z \\sim 1.8$) redshifts. We find that irrespective of obscuration, an increase in AGN bias with redshift is slower than the expectation for a constant halo mass and instead follows the growth rate of halos, known as the passive evolution track. This implies that for those AGNs the clustering is mainly driven by the mass growth rate of the hosting halos and galaxies across cosmic time.\n",
      "31        Mergers between galaxy clusters are an important stage in the formation of the large-scale structure of the Universe. Some of the mergers show a spectacular bow shock that formed as a result of recent passage of a smaller cluster through a bigger one, the classic example of this being the so-called bullet cluster. In this paper, I describe ten examples of interacting clusters identified among 200 of the most massive objects, with total masses above $1.4 \\times 10^{14}$ M$_{\\odot}$, from the IllustrisTNG300 simulation by searching for prominent bow shocks in their temperature maps. Despite different mass ratios of the two merging clusters, the events are remarkably similar in many respects. In all cases, the companion cluster passed close to the main one only once, between 0.9 and 0.3 Gyr ago, with the pericenter distance of 100-530 kpc and a velocity of up to 3400 km s$^{-1}$. The subcluster, typically an order of magnitude smaller in mass than the main cluster before the interaction, loses most of its <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> and gas in the process. The displacement between the collisionless part of the remnant and the bow shock is such that the remnant typically lags behind the shock or coincides with it, with a single exception of the merger occurring with the largest velocity. Usually about 1% of the gas cells in the merging clusters are shocked, and the median Mach numbers of these gas cells are around two. Due to the relatively small size of the simulation box, no close analog of the bullet cluster was found, but I identified one case that is similar in terms of mass, velocity, and displacement. The presented cases bear more resemblance to less extreme observed interacting clusters such as A520 and Coma.\n",
      "32        Microscopic horizonless relics could form in the early universe either directly through gravitational collapse or as stable remnants of the Hawking evaporation of primordial black holes. In both cases they completely or partially evade cosmological constraints arising from Hawking evaporation and in certain mass ranges can explain the entirety of the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>. We systematically explore the stochastic gravitational-wave background associated with the formation of microscopic <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span>-<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> relics in various scenarios, adopting an agnostic approach and discussing the limitations introduced by existing constraints, possible ways to circumvent the latter, and expected astrophysical foregrounds. Interestingly, this signal is at most marginally detectable with current interferometers but could be detectable by third-generations instruments such as the Einstein Telescope, strengthening their potential as discovery machines.\n",
      "33        In direct <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> (DM) detection via scattering off the electrons, the momentum transfer plays a crucial role. Previous work showed that for self-interacting DM, if the DM particle has a size (the so-called puffy DM), the radius effect could dominate the momentum transfer and become another source of velocity dependence for self-scattering cross section. In this work we investigate the direct detection of puffy DM particles with different radii through electron recoil. We find that comparing with the available experimental exclusion limits dominated by the mediator effect for XENON10, XENON100 and XENON1T, the constraints on the puffy DM-electron scattering cross-section become much weaker for large radius DM particles. For small-radius DM particles, the constraints remain similar to the point-like DM case.\n",
      "34        Boson stars are gravitationally bound objects that arise in ultralight <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> models and form in the centers of galactic halos or axion miniclusters. We systematically study the excitations of a boson star, taking into account the mixing between positive and negative frequencies introduced by gravity. We show that the spectrum contains zero-energy modes in the monopole and dipole sectors resulting from spontaneous symmetry breaking by the boson star background. We analyze the general properties of the eigenmodes and derive their orthogonality and completeness conditions which have non-standard form due to the positive-negative frequency mixing. The eigenvalue problem is solved numerically for the first few energy levels in different multipole sectors and the results are compared to the solutions of the Schrödinger equation in fixed boson star gravitational potential. The two solutions differ significantly for the lowest modes, but get close for higher levels. We further confirm the normal mode spectrum in 3D wave simulations where we inject perturbations with different multipoles. As an application of the normal mode solutions, we compute the matrix element entering the evaporation rate of a boson star immersed in a hot axion gas. The computation combines the use of exact wavefunctions for the low-lying bound states and of the Schrödinger approximation for the high-energy excitations.\n",
      "35        If long-range attractive forces exist and are stronger than gravity then cosmic halo formation can begin in the radiation-dominated era. We study a simple realization of this effect in a system where <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> fermions have Yukawa interactions mediated by scalar particles, analogous to the Higgs boson in the standard model. We develop a self-consistent description of the system including exact background dynamics of the scalar field, and precise modelling of the fermion density fluctuations. For the latter, we provide accurate approximations for the linear growth as well as quantitative modelling of the nonlinear evolution using N-body simulations. We find that halo formation occurs exponentially fast and on scales substantially larger than simple estimates predict. The final fate of these halos remains uncertain, but could be annihilation, <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> stars, primordial black holes, or even the existence of galaxy-sized halos at <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>-radiation equality. More generally, our results demonstrate the importance of mapping scalar-mediated interactions onto structure formation outcomes and constraints for beyond the standard model theories.\n",
      "36        Recent analysis on the stellar kinematics of ultra-faint dwarf (UFD) galaxies has put a stringent upper limit on the self-scattering cross section of <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>, i.e., $σ/m&lt;{\\cal O}(0.1)\\,{\\rm cm^2/g}$ at the scattering velocity of ${\\cal O}(10)\\,{\\rm km/s}$. Resonant self-interacting <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> (rSIDM) is one possibility that can be consistent with the UFDs and explain the low central densities of rotation-supported galaxies; the cross section is resonantly enhanced to be $σ/m = {\\cal O}(1)\\,{\\rm cm^2/g}$ around the scattering velocity of ${\\cal O}(100)\\,{\\rm km/s}$ while being suppressed at lower velocities. To further assess this possibility, since the inferred <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> distribution of halos from astrophysical observations is usually compared to that in constant-cross section SIDM (cSIDM), whether the structures of rSIDM halos can be approximated by the cSIDM halo profiles needs to be clarified. In this work, we employ the grovothermal fluid method to investigate the structural evolution of rSIDM halos in a wide mass range. We find that except for halos in a specific mass range, the present structures of rSIDM halos are virtually indistinguishable from those of the cSIDM halos. For halos in the specific mass range, the resonant self-scattering renders a break in their density profile. We demonstrate how such a density-profile break appears in astrophysical observations, e.g., rotation curves and line-of-sight velocity dispersion profiles. We show that for halos above the specific mass range, the density-profile break thermalizes to disappear before the present. We demonstrate that such distinctive thermalization dynamics can leave imprints on the orbital classes of stars with similar ages and metallicities.\n",
      "37        The E-type $α$-attractor models of single-field inflation were generalized further in order to accommodate production of primordial black holes (PBH) via adding a near-inflection point to the inflaton scalar potential at smaller scales, in good agreement with measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation. A minimal number of new parameters was used but their fine-tuning was maximized in order to increase possible masses of PBH formed during an ultra-slow-roll phase leading to a large enhancement of the power spectrum of scalar (curvature) perturbations by 6 or 7 orders of magnitude against the power spectrum of perturbations observed in CMB. It was found that extreme fine-tuning of the parameters in our models can lead to a formation of the Earth-size PBH with the masses of approximately $10^{27}$ g, still in agreement with CMB observations. Quantum corrections are known to lead to the perturbative upper bound on the amplitude of large scalar perturbations responsible for PBH production. The quantum (one-loop) corrections in our models were found to be suppressed by one order of magnitude for PBH with the masses of approximately $10^{19}$ g, which may form the whole <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> in the Universe.\n",
      "38        We discuss in detail the possibility that the &#34;type-II majoron&#34; -- that is, the pseudo Nambu-Goldstone boson that arises in the context of the type-II seesaw mechanism if the lepton number is spontaneously broken by an additional singlet scalar -- account for the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> (DM) observed in the universe. We study the requirements the model&#39;s parameters have to fulfill in order to reproduce the measured DM relic abundance through two possible production mechanisms in the early universe, freeze-in and misalignment, both during a standard radiation-dominated era and early <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> domination. We then study possible signals of type-II majoron DM and the present and expected constraints on the parameter space that can be obtained from cosmological observations, direct detection experiments, and present and future searches for decaying DM at neutrino telescopes and cosmic-ray experiments. We find that -- depending on the majoron mass, the production mechanism, and the value of the vacuum expectation value of the type-II triplet -- all of the three decay modes (photons, electrons, neutrinos) of majoron DM particles can yield observable signals at future indirect searches for DM. Furthermore, in a corner of the parameter space, detection of majoron DM is possible through electron recoil at running and future direct detection experiments.\n",
      "39        Running vacuum models and viscous <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> scenarios beyond perfect fluid idealization are two appealing theoretical strategies that have been separately studied as alternatives to solve some problems rooted in the $Λ$CDM cosmological model. In this paper, we combine these two notions in a single cosmological setting and investigate their cosmological implications, paying particular attention in the interplay between these two constituents in different cosmological periods. Specifically, we consider a well-studied running vacuum model inspired by renormalization group, and a recently proposed general parameterization for the bulk viscosity $ξ$. By employing dynamical system analysis, we explore the physical aspects of the new phase space that emerges from the combined models and derive stability conditions that ensure complete cosmological dynamics. We identify four distinct classes of models and find that the critical points of the phase space are non-trivially renewed compared to the single scenarios. We then proceed, in a joint and complementary way to the dynamical system analysis, with a detailed numerical exploration to quantify the impact of both the running parameter and the bulk viscosity coefficient on the cosmological evolution. Thus, for some values of the model parameters, numerical solutions show qualitative differences from the $Λ$CDM model, which is phenomenologically appealing in light of cosmological observations.\n",
      "40        The intrinsic alignment (IA) of observed galaxy shapes with the underlying cosmic web is a source of contamination in weak lensing surveys. Sensitive methods to identify the IA signal will therefore need to be included in the upcoming weak lensing analysis pipelines. Hydrodynamical cosmological simulations allow us to directly measure the intrinsic ellipticities of galaxies and thus provide a powerful approach to predict and understand the IA signal. Here we employ the novel, large-volume hydrodynamical simulation MTNG740, a product of the MillenniumTNG (MTNG) project, to study the IA of galaxies. We measure the projected correlation functions between the intrinsic shape/shear of galaxies and various tracers of large-scale structure, $w_{+g},\\ w_{+m},\\ w_{++}$ over the radial range $r_{\\rm p} \\in [0.02 , 200]\\,h^{-1}{\\rm Mpc}$ and at redshifts $z=0.0$, $0.5$ and $1.0$. We detect significant signal-to-noise IA signals with the density field for both elliptical and spiral galaxies. We also find significant intrinsic shear-shear correlations for ellipticals. We further examine correlations of the intrinsic shape of galaxies with the local tidal field. Here we find a significant IA signal for elliptical galaxies assuming a linear model. We also detect a weak IA signal for spiral galaxies under a quadratic tidal torquing model. Lastly, we measure the alignment between central galaxies and their host <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span>-<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halos, finding small to moderate misalignments between their principal axes that decline with halo mass.\n",
      "41        We study weak gravitational lensing convergence maps produced from the MillenniumTNG (MTNG) simulations by direct projection of the mass distribution on the past backwards lightcone of a fiducial observer. We explore the lensing maps over a large dynamic range in simulation mass and angular resolution, allowing us to establish a clear assessment of numerical convergence. By comparing full physics hydrodynamical simulations with corresponding <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span>-<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>-only runs we quantify the impact of baryonic physics on the most important weak lensing statistics. Likewise, we predict the impact of massive neutrinos reliably far into the non-linear regime. We also demonstrate that the &#34;fixed &amp; paired&#34; variance suppression technique increases the statistical robustness of the simulation predictions on large scales not only for time slices but also for continuously output lightcone data. We find that both baryonic and neutrino effects substantially impact weak lensing shear measurements, with the latter dominating over the former on large angular scales. Thus, both effects must explicitly be included to obtain sufficiently accurate predictions for stage IV lensing surveys. Reassuringly, our results agree accurately with other simulation results where available, supporting the promise of simulation modelling for precision cosmology far into the non-linear regime.\n",
      "42        An era of kination occurs when the Universe&#39;s energy density is dominated by a fast-rolling scalar field. <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">Dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> that is thermally produced during an era of kination requires larger-than-canonical annihilation cross sections to generate the observed <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> relic abundance. Furthermore, <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> density perturbations that enter the horizon during an era of kination grow linearly with the scale factor prior to radiation domination. We show how the resulting enhancement to the small-scale <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> power spectrum increases the microhalo abundance and boosts the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> annihilation rate. We then use gamma-ray observations to constrain thermal <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> production during kination. The annihilation boost factor depends on the minimum halo mass, which is determined by the small-scale cutoff in the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> power spectrum. Therefore, observational limits on the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> annihilation rate imply a minimum cutoff scale for a given <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> particle mass and kination scenario. For <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> that was once in thermal equilibrium with the Standard Model, this constraint establishes a maximum allowed kinetic decoupling temperature for the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>. This bound on the decoupling temperature implies that the growth of perturbations during kination cannot appreciably boost the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> annihilation rate if <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> was once in thermal equilibrium with the Standard Model.\n",
      "43        We present the measurement of total and stellar/<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> decomposed mass density profile around a sample of galaxy groups and clusters with dynamical masses derived from integral-field stellar kinematics from the MaNGA survey in Paper~I and weak lensing derived from the DECaLS imaging survey. Combining the two data sets enables accurate measurement of the radial density distribution from several kpc to Mpc scales. Intriguingly, we find that the excess surface density derived from stellar kinematics in the inner region cannot be explained by simply adding an NFW <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halo extrapolated from lensing measurement at a larger scale to a stellar mass component derived from the NASA-Sloan Atlas (NSA) catalog. We find that a good fit to both data sets requires a stellar mass normalization about 3 times higher than that derived from the NSA catalog, which would require an unrealistically too-heavy initial mass function for stellar mass estimation. If we keep the stellar mass normalization to that of the NSA catalog but allow a varying inner <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> density profile, we obtain an asymptotic slope of $γ_{\\rm gnfw}$= $1.82_{-0.25}^{+0.15}$, $γ_{\\rm gnfw}$= $1.48_{-0.41}^{+0.20}$ for the group bin and the cluster bin respectively, significantly steeper than the NFW case. We also compare the total mass inner density slopes with those from Illustris-TNG300 and find that the values from the simulation are lower than the observation by at least $3σ$ level.\n",
      "44        We present dynamical scaling relations, combined with the stellar population properties, for a subsample of about 6000 nearby galaxies with the most reliable dynamical models extracted from the full MaNGA sample of 10K galaxies. We show that the inclination-corrected mass plane (MP) for both early-type galaxies (ETGs) and late-type galaxies (LTGs), which links dynamical mass, projected half-light radius $R_{\\rm e}$, and the second stellar velocity moment $σ_{\\rm e}$ within $R_{\\rm e}$, satisfies the virial theorem and is even tighter than the uncorrected one. We find a clear parabolic relation between $\\lg(M/L)(&lt;R_{\\rm e})$, the total mass-to-light ratio within a sphere of radius $R_{\\rm e}$, and $\\lgσ_{\\rm e}$, with the $M/L$ increasing with $σ_{\\rm e}$ and for older stellar populations. However, the relation for ETGs is linear and the one for the youngest galaxies is constant. We confirm and improve the relation between average logarithmic total density slopes $γ_{_{\\rm T}}$ and $σ_{\\rm e}$: $γ_{_{\\rm T}}$ become steeper with increasing $σ_{\\rm e}$ until $\\lg(σ_{\\rm e}/{\\rm km\\,s^{-1}})\\approx 2.2$ and then remain constant around $γ_{_{\\rm T}}\\approx -2.2$. The $γ_{_{\\rm T}}-σ_{\\rm e}$ variation is larger for LTGs than ETGs. At fixed $σ_{\\rm e}$ the total density profiles steepen with galaxy age and for ETGs. We find generally low <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> fractions, median $f_{\\rm DM}(&lt;R_{\\rm e})=8$ per cent, within a sphere of radius $R_{\\rm e}$. However, we find that $f_{\\rm DM}(&lt;R_{\\rm e})$ depends on $σ_{\\rm e}$ better than stellar mass: <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> increases to a median $f_{\\rm DM}=33$ percent for galaxies with $σ_{\\rm e}\\lesssim100{\\rm km\\,s^{-1}}$. The increased $f_{\\rm DM}(&lt;R_{\\rm e})$ at low $σ_{\\rm e}$ explains the parabolic $\\lg(M/L)(&lt;R_{\\rm e})-\\lgσ_{\\rm e}$ relation.\n",
      "45        We analyze the global stellar population, radial gradients and non-parametric star formation history of $\\sim 10$K galaxies from the MaNGA Survey final data release 17 (DR17), based on stellar population synthesis and full-spectrum fitting, and relate them with dynamical properties of galaxies. We confirm that stellar population correlates with stellar velocity dispersion $σ_{\\rm e}$ better than with stellar mass $M_{\\ast}$, but also find that younger galaxies are more metal-poor at fixed $σ_{\\rm e}$. Stellar age, metallicity, and mass-to-light ratio $M_{\\ast}/L$ all decrease with galaxy rotation, while radial gradients become more negative (i.e., younger, more metal-poor, and lower $M_{\\ast}/L$ in the outskirts). The trend between metallicity gradients and rotation reverses for slow rotators, which stand out for their more negative metallicity gradients than faster-rotating galaxies. We highlight a population of massive disk galaxies on the green valley, on the $(σ_{\\rm e},\\rm Age)$ plane, that show steep negative age and metallicity gradients, consistent with their old central bulges surrounded by young star-forming disks and metal-poor gas accretion. Galaxies with high $σ_{\\rm e}$, steep total mass-density slope, low <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> fraction, high $M_{\\ast}/L$, and high metallicity have the highest star-formation rate at earlier times, and are currently quenched.

      "46        This is the first paper in our series on the combined analysis of the Dynamics and stellar Population (DynPop) for the MaNGA survey in the final SDSS Data Release 17 (DR17). Here we present a catalogue of dynamically-determined quantities for over 10000 nearby galaxies based on integral-field stellar kinematics from the MaNGA survey. The dynamical properties are extracted using the axisymmetric Jeans Anisotropic Modelling (JAM) method, which was previously shown to be the most accurate for this kind of study. We assess systematic uncertainties using eight dynamical models with different assumptions. We use two orientations of the velocity ellipsoid: either cylindrically-aligned JAM$_{\\rm cyl}$ or spherically-aligned JAM$_{\\rm sph}$. We also make four assumptions for the models&#39; <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> vs. luminous <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> distributions: (1) mass-follows-light, (2) free NFW <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> halo, (3) cosmologically-constrained NFW halo, (4) generalized NFW <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> halo, i.e. with free inner slope. In this catalogue, we provide the quantities related to the mass distributions (e.g. the density slopes and enclosed mass within a sphere of a given radius for total mass, stellar mass, and <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> mass components). We also provide the complete models which can be used to compute the full luminous and mass distribution of each galaxy. Additionally, we visually assess the qualities of the models to help with model selections. We estimate the observed scatter in the measured quantities which decreases as expected with improvements in quality. For the best data quality, we find a remarkable consistency of measured quantities between different models, highlighting the robustness of the results.\n",
      "47        What is the highest energy at which gravitons can be observed? We address this question by studying graviton-to-photon conversion - the inverse-Gertsenshtein effect - in the magnetic field of the Milky Way. We find that above $\\sim 1~\\mbox{PeV}$ the effective photon mass grows large enough to quench the conversion rate. The induced photon flux is comparable to the sensitivity of LHAASO to a diffuse $γ$-ray background, but only for graviton abundances of order $Ω_{\\text{gw}} h^2_0 \\sim 1$. In the future, owing to a better understanding of $γ$-ray backgrounds, larger effective areas and longer observation times, sub-PeV shimmering gravitons with a realistic abundance of $Ω_{\\text{gw}} h^2_0 \\sim 0.01$ could be detected. We show that this is achieved in a cosmologically-motivated scenario of post-recombination superheavy <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> decay. Therefore, the sub-PeV range might be the ultimate energy frontier at which gravitons can be observed.\n",
      "48        The relation between the total mass contained in the globular clusters of a galaxy and the mass of its <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halo has been found observationally to be nearly linear over five decades of mass. However, the high-mass end of this relation is not well determined from previous data and shows large scatter. We analyze the globular cluster systems (GCSs) of a homogeneous sample of 11 brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) through DOLPHOT photometry of their deep Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images in the F814W filter. We standardize the definition of $M_{GCS}$, the total GCS mass, by using the GC total population within a limiting radius of $0.1 R_{virial}$, while the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span>-<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halo mass $M_h$ is determined from the weak-lensing calibration of $M_h$ versus $M_{bary}$. When these 11 BCGs are added to the previously studied homogeneous catalogue of Virgo member galaxies, a total value for $η= M_{GCS}/M_h$ is found to be $(3.0\\pm1.8_{internal})\\times10^{-5}$, slightly higher than previous estimates but with much reduced uncertainty. Perhaps more importantly, the results suggest that the relation continues to have a near-linear shape at the highest galaxy masses, strongly reinforcing the conclusion that accreted GCs make a major contribution to the GC populations at high galaxy mass.\n",
      "49        We introduce an analytic surface density profile for <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halos that accurately reproduces the structure of simulated halos of mass $M_{\\rm vir} = 10^{7-11}\\ M_\\odot$, making it useful for modeling line-of-sight perturbers in strong gravitational lensing models. The two-parameter function has an analytic deflection potential and is more accurate than the projected Navarro, Frenk &amp; White (NFW) profile commonly adopted at this mass scale for perturbers, especially at the small radii of most relevant for lensing perturbations. Using a characteristic radius, $R_{-1}$, where the log slope of surface density is equal to $-1$, and an associated surface density, $Σ_{-1}$, we can represent the expected lensing signal from line-of-sight halos statistically, for an ensemble of halo orientations, using a distribution of {\\em projected concentration} parameters, $\\mathcal{C}_{\\rm vir} := r_{\\rm vir}/ R_{-1}$. Though an individual halo can have a projected concentration that varies with orientation with respect to the observer, the range of projected concentrations correlates with the usual three-dimensional halo concentration in a way that enables ease of use.\n",

      "51        The most luminous quasars at $z &gt; 6$ are suspected to be both highly clustered and reside in the most massive <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halos in the early Universe, making them prime targets to search for galaxy overdensities and/or protoclusters. We search for Lyman-break dropout-selected galaxies using HST WFC3/ACS broadband imaging in the fields of three $6 &lt; z &lt; 7$ quasars, as well as their simultaneously observed coordinated-parallel fields, and constrain their photometric redshifts using EAZY. One field, J0305-3150, shows a volume density 10$\\times$ higher than the blank-field UV luminosity function (UVLF) at M$_{UV} &lt; -20$, with tentative evidence of a 3$σ$ overdensity in its parallel field located 15 cMpc away. Another field, J2054-0005, shows an angular overdensity within 500 ckpc from the quasar but still consistent with UVLF predictions within 3$σ$, while the last field, J2348-3054, shows no enhancement. We discuss methods for reducing uncertainty in overdensity measurements when using photometric selection and show that we can robustly select LBGs consistent with being physically associated with the quasar, corroborated by existing JWST/NIRCam WFSS data in the J0305 field. Even accounting for incompleteness, the overdensities in J0305 and J2054 are higher for brighter galaxies at short angular separations, suggesting preferential enhancement of more massive galaxies in the immediate vicinity of the quasar. Finally, we compare the LBG population with previously-identified [CII] and mm-continuum companions; the LBG overdensities are not accompanied by an enhanced number of dusty galaxies, suggesting that the overdense quasar fields are not in the bursty star-forming phase sometimes seen in high-redshift protoclusters.\n"

The effects of DM on NS properties, including the mass-radius relation, the moment of inertia, and tidal deformability, are calculated by varying its fraction. The study found that the EOS becomes softer with increasing DM momentum, and the DM has marginal effects on nuclear <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> properties, except for the EOSs and binding energy per particle. The study also calculated the properties of isolated, static, and rotating DM admixed NS and found that the DM has significant effects on both static and rotating NS. We have also observed that a tiny amount of DM can accumulate inside the NS, and more amount of it makes the NS unstable. The study also suggests that the secondary component might be a NS with DM content if the underlying nuclear EOS is sufficiently stiff. The $f$-mode oscillations of the DM admixed hyperon stars are calculated and found that there exist a correlation between canonical $f$-mode frequency and the dimensionless tidal deformability parameter ($Λ_{1.4}$) and we have put a constraint on $f$-mode frequency using GW170817 data. Finally, we have calculated the DM admixed binary NS properties and found that the binary system becomes less deformed and sustains more time in its inspiral phases with the addition of DM. Therefore, we suggest that one can take DM inside the compact objects while modeling the inspiral waveforms for the BNS systems.\n",
      "3        Radiative emissions from electrons and positrons generated by <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> (DM) annihilation or decay are one of the most investigated signals in indirect searches of WIMPs. Ideal targets must have large ratio of DM to baryonic <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>. However, such ``<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span>&#39;&#39; systems have a poorly known level of magnetic turbulence, which determines the residence time of the electrons and positrons and therefore also the strength of the expected signal. This typically leads to significant uncertainties in the derived DM bounds. In a novel approach, we compute the self-confinement of the DM-induced electrons and positrons. Indeed, they themselves generate irregularities in the magnetic field, thus setting a lower limit on the presence of the magnetic turbulence. We specifically apply this approach to dwarf spheroidal galaxies. Finally, by comparing the expected synchrotron emission with radio data from the direction of the Draco galaxy collected at the Giant Metre Radio Telescope, we show that the proposed approach can be used to set robust and competitive bounds on WIMP DM.\n",
      "4        The particle origin of <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> (DM) is still one of the main puzzles in modern physics. One of the most promising search strategy to detect DM at laboratories is through the indirect search of cosmic particles that are produced from DM annihilation in space. In particular, the flux of cosmic positrons has been measured with high precision by the AMS-02 experiment demonstrating that an excess above 10 GeV, with respect to the secondary production, is present. We study in this paper the possible DM origin of the positron excess finding the values of the DM mass $M$ and annihilation cross section $\\langle σv \\rangle$ that are needed to fit high-energy positron data. In particular, we find that for DM annihilating into $b\\bar{b}$ it is required to have $M=43$ TeV and $\\langle σv \\rangle = 10^{-21}$ cm$^3$/s while for $τ^+τ^-$ $M=2$ TeV and $\\langle σv \\rangle = 3\\times 10^{-23}$ cm$^3$/s. If DM produce positrons, they are expected to generate gamma rays from the center of the Milky Way and around dwarf galaxy satellites of the Galaxy. We thus combine the values for the DM mass and annihilation cross section obtained with the fit to AMS-02 positron data with the upper limits derived with the non-detection of $γ$ rays with HESS in the direction of the Galactic center and Fermi-LAT for the combined analysis of dwarf galaxies. The main result of the paper is that only DM annihilating into $μ^+ μ^-$ with a mass around 500 GeV and $\\langle σv \\rangle = 4\\times 10^{-24}$ cm$^3$/s can fit AMS-02 data and be compatible with the upper limits found with $γ$ rays. As for the $τ^+ τ^-$ ($b\\bar{b}$) channel, DM can contribute at most at a few tens $\\%$ (a few \\%) level.\n",

We study a semi-analytical subhalo model for interacting <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> with radiation, based on the extended Press-Schechter formalism and subhalos&#39; tidal evolution prescription. We also test the elastic scattering between DM and neutrinos using observations of Milky-Way satellites from the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">Dark</span> Energy Survey and PanSTARRS1. We conservatively impose strong constraints on the DM-neutrino scattering cross section of $σ_{{\\rm DM}\\text{-}ν,n}\\propto E_ν^n$ $(n=0,2,4)$ at $95\\%$ confidence level (CL), $σ_{{\\rm DM}\\text{-}ν,0}&lt; 10^{-32}\\ {\\rm cm^2}\\ (m_{\\rm DM}/{\\rm GeV})$, $σ_{{\\rm DM}\\text{-}ν,2}&lt; 10^{-43}\\ {\\rm cm^2}\\ (m_{\\rm DM}/{\\rm GeV})(E_ν/E_ν^0)^2$ and $σ_{{\\rm DM}\\text{-}ν,4}&lt; 10^{-54}\\ {\\rm cm^2}\\ (m_{\\rm DM}/{\\rm GeV})(E_ν/E_ν^0)^4$, where $E_ν^0$ is the average momentum of relic cosmic neutrinos today, $E_ν^0 \\simeq 3.15 T_ν^0 \\simeq 6.1\\ {\\rm K}$.

      "6        Numerous observations suggest that there exist undiscovered beyond-the-Standard-Model particles and fields. Because of their unknown nature, these exotic particles and fields could interact with Standard Model particles in many different ways and assume a variety of possible configurations. Here we present an overview of the Global Network of Optical Magnetometers for Exotic physics searches (GNOME), our ongoing experimental program designed to test a wide range of exotic physics scenarios. The GNOME experiment utilizes a worldwide network of shielded atomic magnetometers (and, more recently, comagnetometers) to search for spatially and temporally correlated signals due to torques on atomic spins from exotic fields of astrophysical origin. We survey the temporal characteristics of a variety of possible signals currently under investigation such as those from topological defect <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> (axion-like particle domain walls), axion-like particle stars, solitons of complex-valued scalar fields (Q-balls), stochastic fluctuations of bosonic <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> fields, a solar axion-like particle halo, and bursts of ultralight bosonic fields produced by cataclysmic astrophysical events such as binary black hole mergers.\n",
      "7        Recent observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) are yielding tantalizing hints of an early population of massive, bright galaxies at $z &gt; 10$, with Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) observations indicating significant dust masses in place as early as $z\\sim 7$. To understand the implications of these observations, we use the DELPHI semi-analytic model that jointly tracks the assembly of <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halos and their constituent baryons, including the key processes of dust enrichment. Our model employs only two redshift- and mass-independent free parameters that are tuned against all available galaxy data at $z \\sim 5-9$ before it is used to make predictions up to $z \\sim 20$. Our key results are: (1) the model progressively under-predicts the observed ultraviolet luminosity function (UV LF) at $z &gt; 12$; observations at $z&gt;16$ lie close to, or even above, a &#34;maximal&#34; model where all available gas is turned into stars; (2) UV selection would miss 34% of the star formation rate density at $z \\sim 5$, decreasing to 17% by $z \\sim 10$ for bright galaxies with $\\rm{M_{UV}} &lt; -19$; (3) the dust mass ($M_d$) evolves with the stellar mass ($M_*$) and redshift as $\\log(M_d) = 1.194\\log(M_*) + 0.0975z - 5.433$; (4) the escape fraction of UV photons ($f_{\\rm esc}^{\\rm UV}$) decreases with increasing mass and star formation rate. At $z \\sim 7$, $f_{\\rm esc}^{\\rm UV} \\sim 0.8~(0.1)$ for $M_* \\sim 10^9~ (10^{11}) \\, M_\\odot$ galaxies; (5) the dust temperature increases with stellar mass, ranging between $30-33$ K for $M_* \\sim 10^{9-11}M_\\odot$ galaxies at $z \\sim 7$. Finally, we predict the far infrared (FIR) LF at $z \\sim 5-20$, testable with ALMA observations, and caution that spectroscopic redshifts and dust masses must be pinned down before invoking unphysical extrema in galaxy formation models.\n",
      "8        We reexamine the consequences of perturbative unitarity on <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> freeze-out when both Sommerfeld enhancement and bound state formation affect <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> annihilations. At leading order (LO) the annihilation cross-section is infrared dominated and the connection between the unitarity bound and the upper bound on the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> mass depends only on how the different partial waves are populated. We compute how this picture is modified at next-to-leading order (NLO) with the goal of assigning a reliable theory uncertainty to the freeze-out predictions. We explicitly compute NLO corrections in a simple model with abelian gauge interactions and provide an estimate of the theoretical uncertainty for the thermal masses of heavy electroweak $n$-plets. Along the way, we clarify the regularization and matching procedure necessary to deal with singular potentials in quantum mechanics with a calculable relativistic UV completion.\n",
      "9        We provide an algorithm for evolving general spin-$s$ Gross-Pitaevskii / non-linear Schrödinger systems carrying a variety of interactions, where the $2s+1$ components of the `spinor&#39; field represent the different spin-multiplicity states. We consider many nonrelativistic interactions up to quartic order in the Schrödinger field (both short and long-range, and spin-dependent and spin-independent interactions), including explicit spin-orbit couplings. The algorithm allows for spatially varying external and/or self-generated vector potentials that couple to the spin density of the field. Our work can be used for scenarios ranging from laboratory systems such as spinor Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs), to cosmological/astrophysical systems such as self-interacting bosonic <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>. As examples, we provide results for two different setups of spin-$1$ BECs that employ a varying magnetic field and spin-orbit coupling, respectively, and also collisions of spin-$1$ solitons in <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>.

      "10        We discuss the production of primordial black holes in an early <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> dominated era, which typically takes place in string inspired early universe cosmological models. In particular, we consider a pre-big bang scenario (extending previous results regarding formation in the radiation dominated era) where the enhancement of curvature perturbations is induced by a variation of the sound-speed parameter c_s during the string phase of high-curvature inflation. After imposing all relevant observational constraints, we find that the considered class of models is compatible with the production of a large amount of primordial black holes, in the mass range relevant to <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>, only for a small range of the parameters space. On the other hand, we find that a huge production of light primordial black holes may occur both in such <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> dominated era and in the radiation dominated one.\n",

An indication for a non-zero coupling between <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> and neutrinos (both assuming a temperature independent and $T^2$ dependent cross-section) is obtained at the 1$σ$ level coming from the ACT CMB data alone and when combined with the Planck CMB and Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) measurements. This result is confirmed by both fixing the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom in the early Universe to the Standard Model value of $N_{\\rm eff}=3.044$, and allowing $N_{\\rm eff}$ to be a free cosmological parameter. Furthermore, when performing a Bayesian model comparison, the interacting $ν$DM (+$N_{\\rm eff}$) scenario is mostly preferred over a baseline $Λ$CDM (+$N_{\\rm eff}$) cosmology. The preferred value is then used as a benchmark and the potential implications of <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter&#39;s</span> interaction with a sterile neutrino are discussed.\n",

Our proposed method complements the traditional power spectrum analysis. We compare our CNN classification results with those from the power spectrum of the differential brightness temperature map of 21cm radiation, and find that the CNN outperforms the latter. Moreover, we investigate the impact of baryonic physics on the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> model constraint, including star formation, self-shielding of HI gas, and UV background model.

      "13        The <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> power spectrum has been strongly constrained by astronomical measurements at large scales, but only weakly at small scales. Compared with the standard scenario, the deviation of the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> power spectrum at small scales has influence on the cosmological structure formation, e.g., the comoving number density of <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halos. The thermal history of the intergalactic medium (IGM) can be changed if <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> is made of weakly interacting massive particles and can annihilate into standard model particles. The changes of the evolution of IGM could leave imprints on the relevant astronomical observations.

In view of the measurements of the global 21-cm signal by the EDGES experiment, we explore the allowed parameter space of $m_s$, which describes the degree of deviation, by requiring the differential brightness temperature of the global 21-cm signal $δT_{21} \\le -50~\\rm mK$ at redshift $z=17$.\n",

The $\\ell$-boson stars are numerical solutions to the non-relativistic limit of the Einstein-Klein-Gordon system, the Schrödinger-Poisson (SP) system. These solutions are parametrized by an angular momentum number $\\ell = (N-1)/2$ and an excitation number $n$. We perform a bayesian analysis by modifying the SimpleMC code to perform the parameter inference, for the cases with $\\ell = 0$, $\\ell = 1$ and multistates of $\\ell$-boson stars. We used the Akaike information criterion (AIC), Bayesian information criterion and the Bayes factor to compare the excited state ($\\ell$=1) and the multistate case with the ground state ($\\ell$=0) as the base model due to its simplicity. We found that the data in most galaxies in the sample favours the multistates case and that the scalar field mass tends to be slightly bigger than the ground state case.\n",
      "15        A long-standing observed curiosity of globular clusters (GCs) has been that both the number and total mass of GCs in a galaxy are linearly correlated with the galaxy&#39;s virial mass, whereas its stellar component shows no such linear correlation. This work expands on an empirical model for the numbers and ages of GCs in galaxies presented by Valenzuela et al. (2021) that is consistent with recent observational data from massive elliptical galaxies down to the dwarf galaxy regime. Applying the model to simulations, GC numbers are shown to be excellent tracers for the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> (DM) virial mass, even when distinct formation mechanisms are employed for blue and red GCs. Furthermore, the amount of DM smooth accretion is encoded in the GC abundances, therefore providing a measure for an otherwise nearly untraceable component of the formation history of galaxies.\n",
      "16        We analytically solve the problem of Bose star growth in the bath of gravitationally interacting particles. We find that after nucleation of this object, the bath is described by a self-similar solution of the kinetic equation, which is an attractor. Together with the conservation laws, this fixes mass evolution of the Bose star. Our results explain slowdown of the star growth at a certain &#34;core-halo&#34; mass, but also predict formation of the heavier and lighter objects in magistral <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> models.\n",
      "17        <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">Dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> subhaloes are key for the predictions of simulations of structure formation, but their existence frequently ends prematurely due to two technical issues, namely numerical disruption in N-body simulations and halo finders failing to identify them. Here we focus on the second issue, using the phase-space friends-of-friends halo finder ROCKSTAR as a benchmark (though we expect our results to translate to comparable codes). We confirm that the most prominent cause for losing track of subhaloes is tidal distortion rather than a low number of particles. As a solution, we present a flexible post-processing algorithm that tracks all subhalo particles over time, computes subhalo positions and masses based on those particles, and progressively removes stripped <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>. If a subhalo is lost by the halo finder, this algorithm keeps tracking its so-called ghost until it has almost no particles left or has truly merged with its host. We apply this technique to a large suite of N-body simulations and restore lost subhaloes to the halo catalogues, which has a dramatic effect on key summary statistics of large-scale structure. Specifically, the subhalo mass function increases by about 50% and the halo correlation function increases by a factor of two at small scales. While these quantitative results are somewhat specific to our algorithm, they demonstrate that particle tracking is a promising way to reliably follow haloes and reduce the need for orphan models. Our algorithm and augmented halo catalogues are publicly available.\n",
      "18        Ultralight bosons are predicted in many extensions to the Standard Model and are popular <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> candidates. The black hole superradiance mechanism allows for these particles to be probed using only their gravitational interaction. In this scenario, an ultralight boson cloud may form spontaneously around a spinning black hole and extract a non-negligible fraction of the black hole&#39;s mass. These oscillating clouds produce quasi-monochromatic, long-duration gravitational waves that may be detectable by ground-based or space-based gravitational wave detectors. We discuss the capability of a new long-duration signal tracking method, based on a hidden Markov model, to detect gravitational wave signals generated by ultralight vector boson clouds, including cases where the signal frequency evolution timescale is much shorter than that of a typical continuous wave signal. We quantify the detection horizon distances for vector boson clouds with current- and next-generation ground-based detectors. We demonstrate that vector clouds hosted by black holes with mass $\\gtrsim 60 M_{\\odot}$ and spin $\\gtrsim 0.6$ are within the reach of current-generation detectors up to a luminosity distance of $\\sim 1$ Gpc. This search method enables one to target vector boson clouds around remnant black holes from compact binary mergers detected by gravitational-wave detectors. We discuss the impact of the sky localization of the merger events and demonstrate that a typical remnant black hole reasonably well-localized by the current generation detector network is accessible in a follow-up search.\n",
      "19        Lithium-drifted silicon [Si(Li)] has been used for decades as an ionizing radiation detector in nuclear, particle, and astrophysical experiments, though such detectors have frequently been limited to small sizes (few cm$^2$) and cryogenic operating temperatures. The 10-cm-diameter Si(Li) detectors developed for the General Antiparticle Spectrometer (GAPS) balloon-borne <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> experiment are novel particularly for their requirements of low cost, large sensitive area (~10 m$^2$ for the full 1440-detector array), high temperatures (near -40$\\,^\\circ$C), and energy resolution below 4 keV FWHM for 20--100-keV x-rays. Previous works have discussed the manufacturing, passivation, and small-scale testing of prototype GAPS Si(Li) detectors. Here we show for the first time the results from detailed characterization of over 1100 flight detectors, illustrating the consistent intrinsic low-noise performance of a large sample of GAPS detectors.

The boosted <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">Dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">Matter</span> flux at the edge of the Earth&#39;s atmosphere is expected to be pointing to the Galactic Center, with a flux 15 to 20 times larger than in the transverse direction.\n",
      "21        We investigate the reach of future gravitational wave (GW) detectors in probing inflaton couplings with visible sector particles that can either be bosonic or fermionic in nature. Assuming reheating takes place through perturbative quantum production from vacuum in presence of classical inflaton background field, we find that the spectral energy density of the primordial GW generated during inflation becomes sensitive to inflaton-<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> coupling. We conclude, obeying bounds from Big Bang Nucleosysthesis and Cosmic Microwave Background, that, e.g., inflaton-scalar couplings of the order of $\\sim\\mathcal{O}(10^{-20})$ GeV fall within the sensitivity range of several proposed GW detector facilities. However, this prediction is sensitive to the size of the inflationary scale, nature of the inflaton-<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> interaction and shape of the potential during reheating. Having found the time-dependent effective inflaton decay width, we also discuss its implications for <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> (DM) production from the thermal plasma via UV freeze-in during reheating. It is shown, that one can reproduce the observed DM abundance for its mass up to several PeVs, depending on the dimension of the operator connecting DM with the thermal bath and the associated scale of the UV physics. Thus we promote primordial GW to observables sensitive to feebly coupled inflaton, which is very challenging if not impossible to test in conventional particle physics laboratories or astrophysical measurements.\n",
      "22        We argue that demanding a consistent cosmological history, including the absence of domain walls and strongly interacting relics at the Peccei-Quinn scale, singles out two concrete realizations of hadronic QCD axions as viable <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> models. These realizations generally feature flavor-violating axion couplings to Standard Model quarks that are unsuppressed at low energies. As a consequence, experiments looking for flavor-violating hadronic processes involving the axion can be sensitive probes of QCD axion <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> models. In particular, we show that the NA62 and KOTO experiments could detect the $K\\rightarrowπ+ a$ decay for axions consistent with the observed <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> abundance via the post-inflationary misalignment mechanism.\n",
      "23        The mean <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> density within the turnaround radius, which is the boundary that separates a nonexpanding structure from the Hubble flow, was recently proposed as a novel cosmological probe. According to the spherical collapse model, the evolution with cosmic time of this turnaround density, $\\rm ρ_{ta}(z)$, can be used to determine both $\\rm Ω_m$ and $Ω_Λ$, independently of any other currently used probe. The properties of $\\rm ρ_{ta}$ predicted by the spherical collapse model were also shown to persist in the presence of full three-dimensional effects in $\\rm Λ$CDM N-body cosmological simulations when considering galaxy clusters at the present time, $z=0$. However, a small offset was discovered between the spherical-collapse prediction of the value of $ρ_{ta}$ at $z=0$ and its value measured in simulations. In this letter, we explore whether this offset evolves with cosmic time; whether it differs in different cosmologies; whether its origin can be confidently identified; and whether it can be corrected. We found that the offset does evolve slightly with redshift, and that it correlates strongly with the deviation from spherical symmetry of the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halo distribution inside and outside of the turnaround radius. We used an appropriate metric to quantify deviations in the environment of a structure from spherical symmetry. We found that using this metric, we can construct a sphericity-selected sample of halos for which the offset of $ρ_{ta}$ from the spherical collapse prediction is zero, independently of redshift and cosmology. We found that a sphericity-selected halo sample allows us to recover the simulated cosmology, and we conclude that the turnaround density evolution indeed encodes the cosmology in N-body simulations.\n",
      "24        We present a new suite of over 1,500 cosmological N-body simulations with varied Warm <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">Dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">Matter</span> (WDM) models ranging from 2.5 to 30 keV. We use these simulations to train Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to infer WDM particle masses from images of DM field data. Our fiducial setup can make accurate predictions of the WDM particle mass up to 7.5 keV at a 95% confidence level from small maps that cover an area of (25 h$^{-1}$ Mpc)$^2$. We vary the image resolution, simulation resolution, redshift, and cosmology of our fiducial setup to better understand how our model is making predictions. Using these variations, we find that our models are most dependent on simulation resolution, minimally dependent on image resolution, not systematically dependent on redshift, and robust to varied cosmologies. We also find that an important feature to distinguish between WDM models is present with a linear size between 100 and 200 h$^{-1}$ kpc. We compare our fiducial model to one trained on the power spectrum alone and find that our field-level model can make 2x more precise predictions and can make accurate predictions to 2x as massive WDM particle masses when used on the same data. Overall, we find that the field-level data can be used to accurately differentiate between WDM models and contain more information than is captured by the power spectrum. This technique can be extended to more complex DM models and opens up new opportunities to explore alternative DM models in a cosmological environment.\n",
      "25        The properties of globular clusters (GCs) contain valuable information of their host galaxies and <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span>-<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halos. In the remarkable example of ultra-diffuse galaxy, NGC5846-UDG1, the GC population exhibits strong radial mass segregation, indicative of dynamical-friction-driven orbital decay, which opens the possibility of using imaging data alone to constrain the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span>-<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> content of the galaxy. To explore this possibility, we develop a semi-analytical model of GC evolution, which starts from the initial mass function, the initial structure-mass relation, and the initial spatial distribution of the GC progenitors, and follows the effects of dynamical friction, tidal evolution, and two-body relaxation. Using Markov Chain Monte Carlo, we forward-model the GCs in a NGC5846-UDG1-like potential to match the observed GC mass, size, and spatial distributions, and to constrain the profile of the host halo and the origin of the GCs. We find that, with the assumptions of zero mass segregation when the star clusters were born, NGC5846-UDG1 is <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span>-<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> poor compared to what is expected from stellar-to-halo-mass relations, and its halo concentration is low, irrespective of having a cuspy or a cored halo profile. Its GC population has an initial spatial distribution more extended than the smooth stellar distribution. We discuss the results in the context of scaling laws of galaxy-halo connections, and warn against naively using the GC-abundance-halo-mass relation to infer the halo mass of UDGs. Our model is generally applicable to GC-rich dwarf galaxies, and is publicly available at https://github.com/JiangFangzhou/GCevo.\n",
      "26        The Epoch of Reionization (EoR) neutral Hydrogen (HI) 21-cm signal evolves significantly along the line-of-sight (LoS) due to the light-cone (LC) effect. It is important to accurately incorporate this in simulations in order to correctly interpret the signal. 21-cm LC simulations are typically produced by stitching together slices from a finite number $(N_{\\rm RS})$ of &#39;&#39;reionization snapshot&#39;&#39;, each corresponding to a different stage of reionization. In this paper, we have quantified the errors in the 21-cm LC simulation due to the finite value of $N_{\\rm RS}$. We show that this can introduce large discontinuities $(&gt; 200 \\%)$ at the stitching boundaries when $N_{\\rm RS}$ is small $(= 2,4)$ and the mean neutral fraction jumps by $δ\\bar{x}_{\\rm HI} = 0.2,0.1$ respectively at the stitching boundaries. This drops to $17 \\%$ for $N_{\\rm RS} = 13$ where $δ\\bar{x}_{\\rm HI}=0.02$. We present and also validate a method for mitigating this error by increasing $N_{\\rm RS}$ without a proportional increase in the computational costs which are mainly incurred in generating the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> and halo density fields. Our method generates these fields only at a few redshifts, and interpolates them to generate reionization snapshots at closely spaced redshifts. We use this to generate 21-cm LC simulations with $N_{\\rm RS} = 26,51,101$ and $201$, and show that the errors go down as $N_{\\rm RS}^{-1}$.\n",
      "27        The advent of gravitational wave astronomy has seen a huge influx of new predictions for potential discoveries of beyond the Standard Model fields. The coupling of all fundamental fields to gravity, together with its dominance on large scales, makes gravitational physics a rich laboratory to study fundamental physics. This holds especially true for the search for the elusive <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> photon, a promising <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> candidate. The <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> photon is predicted to generate instabilities in a rotating black hole spacetime, birthing a macroscopic Bose-Einstein condensate. These condensates can especially form around super massive black holes, modifying the dynamical inspiralling process. This then opens another window to leverage future space-borne gravitational wave antennas to join the hunt for the elusive <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> particle. This study builds a preliminary model for the gravitational waveform emitted by such a dressed extreme mass-ratio inspiral. Comparing these waveforms to the vacuum scenario allows projections to the potential constrainability on the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> photon mass by space-borne gravitational wave antennas. The superradiant instability of a massive vector field on a Kerr background is calculated and the modification to the dynamics of an inspiralling solar mass-scale compact object is determined with approximations on the backreaction effect of the cloud on the compact object. The end result is the projection that the LISA mission should be able to constrain the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> photon mass using extreme mass ratio inspirals in the range $[1.8 \\times 10^{-17}, 4.47 \\times 10^{-16}]$ eV.\n",
      "28        Recent observations made by the JWST have revealed a number of massive galaxies at high redshift ($z$). The presence of these galaxies appears at odds with the current $Λ$CDM cosmology. Here we investigate the possibility of alleviating the tension by incorporating uncertainties from three sources in counting massive galaxies at high $z$: cosmic variance, error in stellar mass estimate, and contribution by backsplash. We find that each of the sources can significantly increase the cumulative stellar mass density $ρ_*(&gt;M_*)$ at the high-mass end, and the combination of them can boost the density by more than one order of magnitude. Assuming a star formation efficiency of $ε_* \\sim 0.5$, cosmic variance alone can reduce the tension to $2σ$ level, except the most massive galaxy at $z=8$. Including in addition a lognormal dispersion with a width of 0.3 dex in the stellar mass can bring the observed stellar mass density at $z \\sim 7 - 10$ to the $2σ$ range of the cosmic variance. The tension is completely eliminated when gas stripped from backsplash halos is also taken into account. Our results highlight the importance of fully modeling uncertainties when interpreting observational data of rare objects. We use the constrained simulation, ELUCID, to investigate the descendants of high $z$ massive galaxies. We find that a significant portion of these galaxies end up in massive halos with mass $M_{\\rm halo} &gt; 10^{13} h^{-1}M_\\odot $ at $z=0$. A large fraction of central galaxies in $M_{\\rm halo} \\geqslant 10^{14.5} h^{-1}M_\\odot$ halos today are predicted to contain significant amounts of ancient stars formed in massive galaxies at $z\\sim 8$. This prediction can be tested by studying the structure and stellar population of central galaxies in present-day massive clusters.\n",
      "29        Within the $Λ$CDM cosmology, <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> haloes are comprised of both a smooth component and a population of smaller, gravitationally bound subhaloes. These components are often treated as a single halo when halo properties, such as density profiles, are extracted from simulations. Recent work has shown that density profiles change substantially when subhalo mass is excluded. In this paper, we expand on this result by analysing the change in three specific host halo properties -- concentration ($c_{\\rm{NFW}}$), spin ($λ_{\\rm Bullock}$), and shape ($c/a$), -- when calculated only from the smooth component of the halo. This analysis is performed on both Milky Way-mass haloes and cluster-mass haloes in high-resolution, zoom-in, $N$-body simulations. We find that when subhaloes are excluded the median value of (1) $c_{\\rm{NFW}}$ is enhanced by $\\approx 38 \\pm 12\\%$ and $\\approx 88 \\pm 7.7\\%$ for Milky Way mass ($10^{12.1}\\,\\text{M}_\\odot$) and cluster mass ($10^{14.8}\\,\\text{M}_\\odot$) haloes respectively, (2) $λ_{\\rm Bullock}$ is reduced for Milky Way mass by $\\approx 16 \\pm 6.8\\%$ and cluster mass haloes by $\\approx 32 \\pm 8.9\\%$. Additionally, with the removal of subhaloes, cluster mass haloes tend to become more spherical as the ratio of minor-to-major axis, $c/a$, increases by $\\approx 12 \\pm 4\\%$, whereas Milky Way mass haloes remain approximately the same shape with $c/a$ changed by $\\approx 1.2 \\pm 5.6\\%$. The fractional change of each of these properties depends primarily on the amount of mass that is removed from the halo system and, to a lesser extent, mass accretion history. Our findings demonstrate that the properties of the smooth components of <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> haloes are biased relative to the total mass of the halo including subhaloes.\n",
      "30        In order to test active galactic nucleus (AGN) unification and evolutionary models, we measured the AGN clustering properties as a function of AGN obscuration defined in terms of hydrogen column density, $N_{\\rm H}$. In addition to measuring the clustering of unobscured ($N_{\\rm H} &lt; 10^{22}\\,{\\rm cm}^{-2}$) and moderately obscured ($10^{22} \\leq N_{\\rm H} &lt; 10^{23.5}$) AGNs, we also targeted highly obscured sources ($N_{\\rm H}\\geq 10^{23.5}$) up to redshifts of $z=3$. We have compiled one of the largest samples of X-ray-selected AGNs from a total of eight deep XMM/Chandra surveys. We measured the clustering as a function of both AGN obscuration and redshift using the projected two-point correlation function, $w_{\\rm p}(r_{\\rm p})$. We modeled the large-scale clustering signal, measured the AGN bias, $b(z, N_{\\rm H})$, and interpreted it in terms of the typical AGN host <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halo, $M_{\\rm halo}(z, N_{\\rm H}$). We find no significant dependence of AGN clustering on obscuration, suggesting similar typical masses of the hosting halos as a function of $N_{\\rm H}$. This result matches expectations of AGN unification models, in which AGN obscuration depends mainly on the viewing angle of the obscuring torus. We measured, for the first time, the clustering of highly obscured AGNs and find that these objects reside in halos with typical mass $\\log M_{\\rm halo} = 12.98_{-0.22}^{+0.17} [h^{-1} M_\\odot]$ ($12.28_{-0.19}^{+0.13}$) at low $z \\sim 0.7$ (high $z \\sim 1.8$) redshifts. We find that irrespective of obscuration, an increase in AGN bias with redshift is slower than the expectation for a constant halo mass and instead follows the growth rate of halos, known as the passive evolution track. This implies that for those AGNs the clustering is mainly driven by the mass growth rate of the hosting halos and galaxies across cosmic time.\n",
      "31        Mergers between galaxy clusters are an important stage in the formation of the large-scale structure of the Universe. Some of the mergers show a spectacular bow shock that formed as a result of recent passage of a smaller cluster through a bigger one, the classic example of this being the so-called bullet cluster. In this paper, I describe ten examples of interacting clusters identified among 200 of the most massive objects, with total masses above $1.4 \\times 10^{14}$ M$_{\\odot}$, from the IllustrisTNG300 simulation by searching for prominent bow shocks in their temperature maps. Despite different mass ratios of the two merging clusters, the events are remarkably similar in many respects. In all cases, the companion cluster passed close to the main one only once, between 0.9 and 0.3 Gyr ago, with the pericenter distance of 100-530 kpc and a velocity of up to 3400 km s$^{-1}$. The subcluster, typically an order of magnitude smaller in mass than the main cluster before the interaction, loses most of its <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> and gas in the process. The displacement between the collisionless part of the remnant and the bow shock is such that the remnant typically lags behind the shock or coincides with it, with a single exception of the merger occurring with the largest velocity. Usually about 1% of the gas cells in the merging clusters are shocked, and the median Mach numbers of these gas cells are around two. Due to the relatively small size of the simulation box, no close analog of the bullet cluster was found, but I identified one case that is similar in terms of mass, velocity, and displacement. The presented cases bear more resemblance to less extreme observed interacting clusters such as A520 and Coma.\n",
      "32        Microscopic horizonless relics could form in the early universe either directly through gravitational collapse or as stable remnants of the Hawking evaporation of primordial black holes. In both cases they completely or partially evade cosmological constraints arising from Hawking evaporation and in certain mass ranges can explain the entirety of the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>. We systematically explore the stochastic gravitational-wave background associated with the formation of microscopic <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span>-<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> relics in various scenarios, adopting an agnostic approach and discussing the limitations introduced by existing constraints, possible ways to circumvent the latter, and expected astrophysical foregrounds. Interestingly, this signal is at most marginally detectable with current interferometers but could be detectable by third-generations instruments such as the Einstein Telescope, strengthening their potential as discovery machines.\n",
      "33        In direct <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> (DM) detection via scattering off the electrons, the momentum transfer plays a crucial role. Previous work showed that for self-interacting DM, if the DM particle has a size (the so-called puffy DM), the radius effect could dominate the momentum transfer and become another source of velocity dependence for self-scattering cross section. In this work we investigate the direct detection of puffy DM particles with different radii through electron recoil. We find that comparing with the available experimental exclusion limits dominated by the mediator effect for XENON10, XENON100 and XENON1T, the constraints on the puffy DM-electron scattering cross-section become much weaker for large radius DM particles. For small-radius DM particles, the constraints remain similar to the point-like DM case.\n",
      "34        Boson stars are gravitationally bound objects that arise in ultralight <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> models and form in the centers of galactic halos or axion miniclusters. We systematically study the excitations of a boson star, taking into account the mixing between positive and negative frequencies introduced by gravity. We show that the spectrum contains zero-energy modes in the monopole and dipole sectors resulting from spontaneous symmetry breaking by the boson star background. We analyze the general properties of the eigenmodes and derive their orthogonality and completeness conditions which have non-standard form due to the positive-negative frequency mixing. The eigenvalue problem is solved numerically for the first few energy levels in different multipole sectors and the results are compared to the solutions of the Schrödinger equation in fixed boson star gravitational potential. The two solutions differ significantly for the lowest modes, but get close for higher levels. We further confirm the normal mode spectrum in 3D wave simulations where we inject perturbations with different multipoles. As an application of the normal mode solutions, we compute the matrix element entering the evaporation rate of a boson star immersed in a hot axion gas. The computation combines the use of exact wavefunctions for the low-lying bound states and of the Schrödinger approximation for the high-energy excitations.\n",
      "35        If long-range attractive forces exist and are stronger than gravity then cosmic halo formation can begin in the radiation-dominated era. We study a simple realization of this effect in a system where <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> fermions have Yukawa interactions mediated by scalar particles, analogous to the Higgs boson in the standard model. We develop a self-consistent description of the system including exact background dynamics of the scalar field, and precise modelling of the fermion density fluctuations. For the latter, we provide accurate approximations for the linear growth as well as quantitative modelling of the nonlinear evolution using N-body simulations. We find that halo formation occurs exponentially fast and on scales substantially larger than simple estimates predict. The final fate of these halos remains uncertain, but could be annihilation, <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> stars, primordial black holes, or even the existence of galaxy-sized halos at <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>-radiation equality. More generally, our results demonstrate the importance of mapping scalar-mediated interactions onto structure formation outcomes and constraints for beyond the standard model theories.\n",
      "36        Recent analysis on the stellar kinematics of ultra-faint dwarf (UFD) galaxies has put a stringent upper limit on the self-scattering cross section of <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>, i.e., $σ/m&lt;{\\cal O}(0.1)\\,{\\rm cm^2/g}$ at the scattering velocity of ${\\cal O}(10)\\,{\\rm km/s}$. Resonant self-interacting <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> (rSIDM) is one possibility that can be consistent with the UFDs and explain the low central densities of rotation-supported galaxies; the cross section is resonantly enhanced to be $σ/m = {\\cal O}(1)\\,{\\rm cm^2/g}$ around the scattering velocity of ${\\cal O}(100)\\,{\\rm km/s}$ while being suppressed at lower velocities. To further assess this possibility, since the inferred <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> distribution of halos from astrophysical observations is usually compared to that in constant-cross section SIDM (cSIDM), whether the structures of rSIDM halos can be approximated by the cSIDM halo profiles needs to be clarified. In this work, we employ the grovothermal fluid method to investigate the structural evolution of rSIDM halos in a wide mass range. We find that except for halos in a specific mass range, the present structures of rSIDM halos are virtually indistinguishable from those of the cSIDM halos. For halos in the specific mass range, the resonant self-scattering renders a break in their density profile. We demonstrate how such a density-profile break appears in astrophysical observations, e.g., rotation curves and line-of-sight velocity dispersion profiles. We show that for halos above the specific mass range, the density-profile break thermalizes to disappear before the present. We demonstrate that such distinctive thermalization dynamics can leave imprints on the orbital classes of stars with similar ages and metallicities.\n",
      "37        The E-type $α$-attractor models of single-field inflation were generalized further in order to accommodate production of primordial black holes (PBH) via adding a near-inflection point to the inflaton scalar potential at smaller scales, in good agreement with measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation. A minimal number of new parameters was used but their fine-tuning was maximized in order to increase possible masses of PBH formed during an ultra-slow-roll phase leading to a large enhancement of the power spectrum of scalar (curvature) perturbations by 6 or 7 orders of magnitude against the power spectrum of perturbations observed in CMB. It was found that extreme fine-tuning of the parameters in our models can lead to a formation of the Earth-size PBH with the masses of approximately $10^{27}$ g, still in agreement with CMB observations. Quantum corrections are known to lead to the perturbative upper bound on the amplitude of large scalar perturbations responsible for PBH production. The quantum (one-loop) corrections in our models were found to be suppressed by one order of magnitude for PBH with the masses of approximately $10^{19}$ g, which may form the whole <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> in the Universe.\n",
      "38        We discuss in detail the possibility that the &#34;type-II majoron&#34; -- that is, the pseudo Nambu-Goldstone boson that arises in the context of the type-II seesaw mechanism if the lepton number is spontaneously broken by an additional singlet scalar -- account for the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> (DM) observed in the universe. We study the requirements the model&#39;s parameters have to fulfill in order to reproduce the measured DM relic abundance through two possible production mechanisms in the early universe, freeze-in and misalignment, both during a standard radiation-dominated era and early <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> domination. We then study possible signals of type-II majoron DM and the present and expected constraints on the parameter space that can be obtained from cosmological observations, direct detection experiments, and present and future searches for decaying DM at neutrino telescopes and cosmic-ray experiments. We find that -- depending on the majoron mass, the production mechanism, and the value of the vacuum expectation value of the type-II triplet -- all of the three decay modes (photons, electrons, neutrinos) of majoron DM particles can yield observable signals at future indirect searches for DM. Furthermore, in a corner of the parameter space, detection of majoron DM is possible through electron recoil at running and future direct detection experiments.\n",
      "39        Running vacuum models and viscous <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> scenarios beyond perfect fluid idealization are two appealing theoretical strategies that have been separately studied as alternatives to solve some problems rooted in the $Λ$CDM cosmological model. In this paper, we combine these two notions in a single cosmological setting and investigate their cosmological implications, paying particular attention in the interplay between these two constituents in different cosmological periods. Specifically, we consider a well-studied running vacuum model inspired by renormalization group, and a recently proposed general parameterization for the bulk viscosity $ξ$. By employing dynamical system analysis, we explore the physical aspects of the new phase space that emerges from the combined models and derive stability conditions that ensure complete cosmological dynamics. We identify four distinct classes of models and find that the critical points of the phase space are non-trivially renewed compared to the single scenarios. We then proceed, in a joint and complementary way to the dynamical system analysis, with a detailed numerical exploration to quantify the impact of both the running parameter and the bulk viscosity coefficient on the cosmological evolution. Thus, for some values of the model parameters, numerical solutions show qualitative differences from the $Λ$CDM model, which is phenomenologically appealing in light of cosmological observations.\n",
      "40        The intrinsic alignment (IA) of observed galaxy shapes with the underlying cosmic web is a source of contamination in weak lensing surveys. Sensitive methods to identify the IA signal will therefore need to be included in the upcoming weak lensing analysis pipelines. Hydrodynamical cosmological simulations allow us to directly measure the intrinsic ellipticities of galaxies and thus provide a powerful approach to predict and understand the IA signal. Here we employ the novel, large-volume hydrodynamical simulation MTNG740, a product of the MillenniumTNG (MTNG) project, to study the IA of galaxies. We measure the projected correlation functions between the intrinsic shape/shear of galaxies and various tracers of large-scale structure, $w_{+g},\\ w_{+m},\\ w_{++}$ over the radial range $r_{\\rm p} \\in [0.02 , 200]\\,h^{-1}{\\rm Mpc}$ and at redshifts $z=0.0$, $0.5$ and $1.0$. We detect significant signal-to-noise IA signals with the density field for both elliptical and spiral galaxies. We also find significant intrinsic shear-shear correlations for ellipticals. We further examine correlations of the intrinsic shape of galaxies with the local tidal field. Here we find a significant IA signal for elliptical galaxies assuming a linear model. We also detect a weak IA signal for spiral galaxies under a quadratic tidal torquing model. Lastly, we measure the alignment between central galaxies and their host <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span>-<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halos, finding small to moderate misalignments between their principal axes that decline with halo mass.\n",
      "41        We study weak gravitational lensing convergence maps produced from the MillenniumTNG (MTNG) simulations by direct projection of the mass distribution on the past backwards lightcone of a fiducial observer. We explore the lensing maps over a large dynamic range in simulation mass and angular resolution, allowing us to establish a clear assessment of numerical convergence. By comparing full physics hydrodynamical simulations with corresponding <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span>-<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>-only runs we quantify the impact of baryonic physics on the most important weak lensing statistics. Likewise, we predict the impact of massive neutrinos reliably far into the non-linear regime. We also demonstrate that the &#34;fixed &amp; paired&#34; variance suppression technique increases the statistical robustness of the simulation predictions on large scales not only for time slices but also for continuously output lightcone data. We find that both baryonic and neutrino effects substantially impact weak lensing shear measurements, with the latter dominating over the former on large angular scales. Thus, both effects must explicitly be included to obtain sufficiently accurate predictions for stage IV lensing surveys. Reassuringly, our results agree accurately with other simulation results where available, supporting the promise of simulation modelling for precision cosmology far into the non-linear regime.\n",
      "42        An era of kination occurs when the Universe&#39;s energy density is dominated by a fast-rolling scalar field. <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">Dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> that is thermally produced during an era of kination requires larger-than-canonical annihilation cross sections to generate the observed <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> relic abundance. Furthermore, <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> density perturbations that enter the horizon during an era of kination grow linearly with the scale factor prior to radiation domination. We show how the resulting enhancement to the small-scale <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> power spectrum increases the microhalo abundance and boosts the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> annihilation rate. We then use gamma-ray observations to constrain thermal <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> production during kination. The annihilation boost factor depends on the minimum halo mass, which is determined by the small-scale cutoff in the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> power spectrum. Therefore, observational limits on the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> annihilation rate imply a minimum cutoff scale for a given <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> particle mass and kination scenario.

      "43        We present the measurement of total and stellar/<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> decomposed mass density profile around a sample of galaxy groups and clusters with dynamical masses derived from integral-field stellar kinematics from the MaNGA survey in Paper~I and weak lensing derived from the DECaLS imaging survey. Combining the two data sets enables accurate measurement of the radial density distribution from several kpc to Mpc scales. Intriguingly, we find that the excess surface density derived from stellar kinematics in the inner region cannot be explained by simply adding an NFW <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halo extrapolated from lensing measurement at a larger scale to a stellar mass component derived from the NASA-Sloan Atlas (NSA) catalog. We find that a good fit to both data sets requires a stellar mass normalization about 3 times higher than that derived from the NSA catalog, which would require an unrealistically too-heavy initial mass function for stellar mass estimation. If we keep the stellar mass normalization to that of the NSA catalog but allow a varying inner <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> density profile, we obtain an asymptotic slope of $γ_{\\rm gnfw}$= $1.82_{-0.25}^{+0.15}$, $γ_{\\rm gnfw}$= $1.48_{-0.41}^{+0.20}$ for the group bin and the cluster bin respectively, significantly steeper than the NFW case. We also compare the total mass inner density slopes with those from Illustris-TNG300 and find that the values from the simulation are lower than the observation by at least $3σ$ level.\n",
      "44        We present dynamical scaling relations, combined with the stellar population properties, for a subsample of about 6000 nearby galaxies with the most reliable dynamical models extracted from the full MaNGA sample of 10K galaxies. We show that the inclination-corrected mass plane (MP) for both early-type galaxies (ETGs) and late-type galaxies (LTGs), which links dynamical mass, projected half-light radius $R_{\\rm e}$, and the second stellar velocity moment $σ_{\\rm e}$ within $R_{\\rm e}$, satisfies the virial theorem and is even tighter than the uncorrected one. We find a clear parabolic relation between $\\lg(M/L)(&lt;R_{\\rm e})$, the total mass-to-light ratio within a sphere of radius $R_{\\rm e}$, and $\\lgσ_{\\rm e}$, with the $M/L$ increasing with $σ_{\\rm e}$ and for older stellar populations. However, the relation for ETGs is linear and the one for the youngest galaxies is constant. We confirm and improve the relation between average logarithmic total density slopes $γ_{_{\\rm T}}$ and $σ_{\\rm e}$: $γ_{_{\\rm T}}$ become steeper with increasing $σ_{\\rm e}$ until $\\lg(σ_{\\rm e}/{\\rm km\\,s^{-1}})\\approx 2.2$ and then remain constant around $γ_{_{\\rm T}}\\approx -2.2$. The $γ_{_{\\rm T}}-σ_{\\rm e}$ variation is larger for LTGs than ETGs. At fixed $σ_{\\rm e}$ the total density profiles steepen with galaxy age and for ETGs. We find generally low <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> fractions, median $f_{\\rm DM}(&lt;R_{\\rm e})=8$ per cent, within a sphere of radius $R_{\\rm e}$.

We confirm that stellar population correlates with stellar velocity dispersion $σ_{\\rm e}$ better than with stellar mass $M_{\\ast}$, but also find that younger galaxies are more metal-poor at fixed $σ_{\\rm e}$. Stellar age, metallicity, and mass-to-light ratio $M_{\\ast}/L$ all decrease with galaxy rotation, while radial gradients become more negative (i.e., younger, more metal-poor, and lower $M_{\\ast}/L$ in the outskirts). The trend between metallicity gradients and rotation reverses for slow rotators, which stand out for their more negative metallicity gradients than faster-rotating galaxies. We highlight a population of massive disk galaxies on the green valley, on the $(σ_{\\rm e},\\rm Age)$ plane, that show steep negative age and metallicity gradients, consistent with their old central bulges surrounded by young star-forming disks and metal-poor gas accretion.

      "46        This is the first paper in our series on the combined analysis of the Dynamics and stellar Population (DynPop) for the MaNGA survey in the final SDSS Data Release 17 (DR17). Here we present a catalogue of dynamically-determined quantities for over 10000 nearby galaxies based on integral-field stellar kinematics from the MaNGA survey. The dynamical properties are extracted using the axisymmetric Jeans Anisotropic Modelling (JAM) method, which was previously shown to be the most accurate for this kind of study. We assess systematic uncertainties using eight dynamical models with different assumptions. We use two orientations of the velocity ellipsoid: either cylindrically-aligned JAM$_{\\rm cyl}$ or spherically-aligned JAM$_{\\rm sph}$. We also make four assumptions for the models&#39; <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> vs. luminous <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> distributions: (1) mass-follows-light, (2) free NFW <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> halo, (3) cosmologically-constrained NFW halo, (4) generalized NFW <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> halo, i.e. with free inner slope. In this catalogue, we provide the quantities related to the mass distributions (e.g. the density slopes and enclosed mass within a sphere of a given radius for total mass, stellar mass, and <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> mass components). We also provide the complete models which can be used to compute the full luminous and mass distribution of each galaxy. Additionally, we visually assess the qualities of the models to help with model selections. We estimate the observed scatter in the measured quantities which decreases as expected with improvements in quality. For the best data quality, we find a remarkable consistency of measured quantities between different models, highlighting the robustness of the results.\n",
      "47        What is the highest energy at which gravitons can be observed? We address this question by studying graviton-to-photon conversion - the inverse-Gertsenshtein effect - in the magnetic field of the Milky Way. We find that above $\\sim 1~\\mbox{PeV}$ the effective photon mass grows large enough to quench the conversion rate. The induced photon flux is comparable to the sensitivity of LHAASO to a diffuse $γ$-ray background, but only for graviton abundances of order $Ω_{\\text{gw}} h^2_0 \\sim 1$. In the future, owing to a better understanding of $γ$-ray backgrounds, larger effective areas and longer observation times, sub-PeV shimmering gravitons with a realistic abundance of $Ω_{\\text{gw}} h^2_0 \\sim 0.01$ could be detected. We show that this is achieved in a cosmologically-motivated scenario of post-recombination superheavy <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> decay. Therefore, the sub-PeV range might be the ultimate energy frontier at which gravitons can be observed.\n",
      "48        The relation between the total mass contained in the globular clusters of a galaxy and the mass of its <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halo has been found observationally to be nearly linear over five decades of mass. However, the high-mass end of this relation is not well determined from previous data and shows large scatter. We analyze the globular cluster systems (GCSs) of a homogeneous sample of 11 brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) through DOLPHOT photometry of their deep Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images in the F814W filter. We standardize the definition of $M_{GCS}$, the total GCS mass, by using the GC total population within a limiting radius of $0.1 R_{virial}$, while the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span>-<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halo mass $M_h$ is determined from the weak-lensing calibration of $M_h$ versus $M_{bary}$. When these 11 BCGs are added to the previously studied homogeneous catalogue of Virgo member galaxies, a total value for $η= M_{GCS}/M_h$ is found to be $(3.0\\pm1.8_{internal})\\times10^{-5}$, slightly higher than previous estimates but with much reduced uncertainty. Perhaps more importantly, the results suggest that the relation continues to have a near-linear shape at the highest galaxy masses, strongly reinforcing the conclusion that accreted GCs make a major contribution to the GC populations at high galaxy mass.\n",
      "49        We introduce an analytic surface density profile for <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halos that accurately reproduces the structure of simulated halos of mass $M_{\\rm vir} = 10^{7-11}\\ M_\\odot$, making it useful for modeling line-of-sight perturbers in strong gravitational lensing models. The two-parameter function has an analytic deflection potential and is more accurate than the projected Navarro, Frenk &amp; White (NFW) profile commonly adopted at this mass scale for perturbers, especially at the small radii of most relevant for lensing perturbations. Using a characteristic radius, $R_{-1}$, where the log slope of surface density is equal to $-1$, and an associated surface density, $Σ_{-1}$, we can represent the expected lensing signal from line-of-sight halos statistically, for an ensemble of halo orientations, using a distribution of {\\em projected concentration} parameters, $\\mathcal{C}_{\\rm vir} := r_{\\rm vir}/ R_{-1}$. Though an individual halo can have a projected concentration that varies with orientation with respect to the observer, the range of projected concentrations correlates with the usual three-dimensional halo concentration in a way that enables ease of use.\n",
      "50        Axions and axion-like particles (ALPs) are a prominent <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> candidate, drawing motivation in part from the axiverse of string theory. Axion-like particles can also arise as composite degrees of freedom of a <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> sector, for example, as <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> pions in <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> Quantum Chromo-Dynamics. In a <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> Standard Model (SM) wherein all 6 quark flavors are light while the photon is massive, one finds a rich low-energy spectrum of stable and ultralight particles, in the form of neutral and charged <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> scalars, and complex neutral scalars analogous to the SM kaon, with mass splittings determined by the mass and charge of the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> quarks. The model finds a natural portal to the visible sector via kinetic coupling of the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> and visible photons, and consequent millicharges for <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>. The <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> can be a mixture of all these ultralight bosonic degrees of freedom, and exhibit both parity-even and parity-odd interactions, making the theory testable at a wide variety of experiments. In context of <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> QCD with $N_f$ flavors of light quarks, this scenario predicts $N_f^2-1$ ultralight axion-like particles -- effectively an axiverse from <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> QCD. This &#39;$π$-axiverse&#39; is consistent with but makes no recourse to string theory, and is complementary to the conventional string theory axiverse.\n",
      "51        The most luminous quasars at $z &gt; 6$ are suspected to be both highly clustered and reside in the most massive <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halos in the early Universe, making them prime targets to search for galaxy overdensities and/or protoclusters. We search for Lyman-break dropout-selected galaxies using HST WFC3/ACS broadband imaging in the fields of three $6 &lt; z &lt; 7$ quasars, as well as their simultaneously observed coordinated-parallel fields, and constrain their photometric redshifts using EAZY. One field, J0305-3150, shows a volume density 10$\\times$ higher than the blank-field UV luminosity function (UVLF) at M$_{UV} &lt; -20$, with tentative evidence of a 3$σ$ overdensity in its parallel field located 15 cMpc away. Another field, J2054-0005, shows an angular overdensity within 500 ckpc from the quasar but still consistent with UVLF predictions within 3$σ$, while the last field, J2348-3054, shows no enhancement. We discuss methods for reducing uncertainty in overdensity measurements when using photometric selection and show that we can robustly select LBGs consistent with being physically associated with the quasar, corroborated by existing JWST/NIRCam WFSS data in the J0305 field. Even accounting for incompleteness, the overdensities in J0305 and J2054 are higher for brighter galaxies at short angular separations, suggesting preferential enhancement of more massive galaxies in the immediate vicinity of the quasar. Finally, we compare the LBG population with previously-identified [CII] and mm-continuum companions; the LBG overdensities are not accompanied by an enhanced number of dusty galaxies, suggesting that the overdense quasar fields are not in the bursty star-forming phase sometimes seen in high-redshift protoclusters.\n"

      "2        This thesis explores the effects of <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> (DM) on neutron stars (NSs) using the relativistic mean-field (RMF) model. The effects of DM on NS properties, including the mass-radius relation, the moment of inertia, and tidal deformability, are calculated by varying its fraction. The study found that the EOS becomes softer with increasing DM momentum, and the DM has marginal effects on nuclear <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> properties, except for the EOSs and binding energy per particle. The study also calculated the properties of isolated, static, and rotating DM admixed NS and found that the DM has significant effects on both static and rotating NS. We have also observed that a tiny amount of DM can accumulate inside the NS, and more amount of it makes the NS unstable. The study also suggests that the secondary component might be a NS with DM content if the underlying nuclear EOS is sufficiently stiff. The $f$-mode oscillations of the DM admixed hyperon stars are calculated and found that there exist a correlation between canonical $f$-mode frequency and the dimensionless tidal deformability parameter ($Λ_{1.4}$) and we have put a constraint on $f$-mode frequency using GW170817 data. Finally, we have calculated the DM admixed binary NS properties and found that the binary system becomes less deformed and sustains more time in its inspiral phases with the addition of DM. Therefore, we suggest that one can take DM inside the compact objects while modeling the inspiral waveforms for the BNS systems.\n",
      "3        Radiative emissions from electrons and positrons generated by <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> (DM) annihilation or decay are one of the most investigated signals in indirect searches of WIMPs. Ideal targets must have large ratio of DM to baryonic <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>. However, such ``<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span>&#39;&#39; systems have a poorly known level of magnetic turbulence, which determines the residence time of the electrons and positrons and therefore also the strength of the expected signal. This typically leads to significant uncertainties in the derived DM bounds. In a novel approach, we compute the self-confinement of the DM-induced electrons and positrons. Indeed, they themselves generate irregularities in the magnetic field, thus setting a lower limit on the presence of the magnetic turbulence. We specifically apply this approach to dwarf spheroidal galaxies. Finally, by comparing the expected synchrotron emission with radio data from the direction of the Draco galaxy collected at the Giant Metre Radio Telescope, we show that the proposed approach can be used to set robust and competitive bounds on WIMP DM.\n",
      "4        The particle origin of <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> (DM) is still one of the main puzzles in modern physics. One of the most promising search strategy to detect DM at laboratories is through the indirect search of cosmic particles that are produced from DM annihilation in space. In particular, the flux of cosmic positrons has been measured with high precision by the AMS-02 experiment demonstrating that an excess above 10 GeV, with respect to the secondary production, is present. We study in this paper the possible DM origin of the positron excess finding the values of the DM mass $M$ and annihilation cross section $\\langle σv \\rangle$ that are needed to fit high-energy positron data. In particular, we find that for DM annihilating into $b\\bar{b}$ it is required to have $M=43$ TeV and $\\langle σv \\rangle = 10^{-21}$ cm$^3$/s while for $τ^+τ^-$ $M=2$ TeV and $\\langle σv \\rangle = 3\\times 10^{-23}$ cm$^3$/s. If DM produce positrons, they are expected to generate gamma rays from the center of the Milky Way and around dwarf galaxy satellites of the Galaxy. We thus combine the values for the DM mass and annihilation cross section obtained with the fit to AMS-02 positron data with the upper limits derived with the non-detection of $γ$ rays with HESS in the direction of the Galactic center and Fermi-LAT for the combined analysis of dwarf galaxies. The main result of the paper is that only DM annihilating into $μ^+ μ^-$ with a mass around 500 GeV and $\\langle σv \\rangle = 4\\times 10^{-24}$ cm$^3$/s can fit AMS-02 data and be compatible with the upper limits found with $γ$ rays. As for the $τ^+ τ^-$ ($b\\bar{b}$) channel, DM can contribute at most at a few tens $\\%$ (a few \\%) level.\n",

We study a semi-analytical subhalo model for interacting <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> with radiation, based on the extended Press-Schechter formalism and subhalos&#39; tidal evolution prescription. We also test the elastic scattering between DM and neutrinos using observations of Milky-Way satellites from the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">Dark</span> Energy Survey and PanSTARRS1. We conservatively impose strong constraints on the DM-neutrino scattering cross section of $σ_{{\\rm DM}\\text{-}ν,n}\\propto E_ν^n$ $(n=0,2,4)$ at $95\\%$ confidence level (CL), $σ_{{\\rm DM}\\text{-}ν,0}&lt; 10^{-32}\\ {\\rm cm^2}\\ (m_{\\rm DM}/{\\rm GeV})$, $σ_{{\\rm DM}\\text{-}ν,2}&lt; 10^{-43}\\ {\\rm cm^2}\\ (m_{\\rm DM}/{\\rm GeV})(E_ν/E_ν^0)^2$ and $σ_{{\\rm DM}\\text{-}ν,4}&lt; 10^{-54}\\ {\\rm cm^2}\\ (m_{\\rm DM}/{\\rm GeV})(E_ν/E_ν^0)^4$, where $E_ν^0$ is the average momentum of relic cosmic neutrinos today, $E_ν^0 \\simeq 3.15 T_ν^0 \\simeq 6.1\\ {\\rm K}$.

      "6        Numerous observations suggest that there exist undiscovered beyond-the-Standard-Model particles and fields. Because of their unknown nature, these exotic particles and fields could interact with Standard Model particles in many different ways and assume a variety of possible configurations. Here we present an overview of the Global Network of Optical Magnetometers for Exotic physics searches (GNOME), our ongoing experimental program designed to test a wide range of exotic physics scenarios. The GNOME experiment utilizes a worldwide network of shielded atomic magnetometers (and, more recently, comagnetometers) to search for spatially and temporally correlated signals due to torques on atomic spins from exotic fields of astrophysical origin. We survey the temporal characteristics of a variety of possible signals currently under investigation such as those from topological defect <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> (axion-like particle domain walls), axion-like particle stars, solitons of complex-valued scalar fields (Q-balls), stochastic fluctuations of bosonic <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> fields, a solar axion-like particle halo, and bursts of ultralight bosonic fields produced by cataclysmic astrophysical events such as binary black hole mergers.\n",
      "7        Recent observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) are yielding tantalizing hints of an early population of massive, bright galaxies at $z &gt; 10$, with Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) observations indicating significant dust masses in place as early as $z\\sim 7$. To understand the implications of these observations, we use the DELPHI semi-analytic model that jointly tracks the assembly of <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halos and their constituent baryons, including the key processes of dust enrichment. Our model employs only two redshift- and mass-independent free parameters that are tuned against all available galaxy data at $z \\sim 5-9$ before it is used to make predictions up to $z \\sim 20$. Our key results are: (1) the model progressively under-predicts the observed ultraviolet luminosity function (UV LF) at $z &gt; 12$; observations at $z&gt;16$ lie close to, or even above, a &#34;maximal&#34; model where all available gas is turned into stars; (2) UV selection would miss 34% of the star formation rate density at $z \\sim 5$, decreasing to 17% by $z \\sim 10$ for bright galaxies with $\\rm{M_{UV}} &lt; -19$; (3) the dust mass ($M_d$) evolves with the stellar mass ($M_*$) and redshift as $\\log(M_d) = 1.194\\log(M_*) + 0.0975z - 5.433$; (4) the escape fraction of UV photons ($f_{\\rm esc}^{\\rm UV}$) decreases with increasing mass and star formation rate. At $z \\sim 7$, $f_{\\rm esc}^{\\rm UV} \\sim 0.8~(0.1)$ for $M_* \\sim 10^9~ (10^{11}) \\, M_\\odot$ galaxies; (5) the dust temperature increases with stellar mass, ranging between $30-33$ K for $M_* \\sim 10^{9-11}M_\\odot$ galaxies at $z \\sim 7$. Finally, we predict the far infrared (FIR) LF at $z \\sim 5-20$, testable with ALMA observations, and caution that spectroscopic redshifts and dust masses must be pinned down before invoking unphysical extrema in galaxy formation models.\n",
      "8        We reexamine the consequences of perturbative unitarity on <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> freeze-out when both Sommerfeld enhancement and bound state formation affect <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> annihilations. At leading order (LO) the annihilation cross-section is infrared dominated and the connection between the unitarity bound and the upper bound on the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> mass depends only on how the different partial waves are populated. We compute how this picture is modified at next-to-leading order (NLO) with the goal of assigning a reliable theory uncertainty to the freeze-out predictions. We explicitly compute NLO corrections in a simple model with abelian gauge interactions and provide an estimate of the theoretical uncertainty for the thermal masses of heavy electroweak $n$-plets. Along the way, we clarify the regularization and matching procedure necessary to deal with singular potentials in quantum mechanics with a calculable relativistic UV completion.\n",
      "9        We provide an algorithm for evolving general spin-$s$ Gross-Pitaevskii / non-linear Schrödinger systems carrying a variety of interactions, where the $2s+1$ components of the `spinor&#39; field represent the different spin-multiplicity states. We consider many nonrelativistic interactions up to quartic order in the Schrödinger field (both short and long-range, and spin-dependent and spin-independent interactions), including explicit spin-orbit couplings. The algorithm allows for spatially varying external and/or self-generated vector potentials that couple to the spin density of the field. Our work can be used for scenarios ranging from laboratory systems such as spinor Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs), to cosmological/astrophysical systems such as self-interacting bosonic <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>.

      "10        We discuss the production of primordial black holes in an early <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> dominated era, which typically takes place in string inspired early universe cosmological models. In particular, we consider a pre-big bang scenario (extending previous results regarding formation in the radiation dominated era) where the enhancement of curvature perturbations is induced by a variation of the sound-speed parameter c_s during the string phase of high-curvature inflation. After imposing all relevant observational constraints, we find that the considered class of models is compatible with the production of a large amount of primordial black holes, in the mass range relevant to <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>, only for a small range of the parameters space.

An indication for a non-zero coupling between <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> and neutrinos (both assuming a temperature independent and $T^2$ dependent cross-section) is obtained at the 1$σ$ level coming from the ACT CMB data alone and when combined with the Planck CMB and Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) measurements. This result is confirmed by both fixing the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom in the early Universe to the Standard Model value of $N_{\\rm eff}=3.044$, and allowing $N_{\\rm eff}$ to be a free cosmological parameter. Furthermore, when performing a Bayesian model comparison, the interacting $ν$DM (+$N_{\\rm eff}$) scenario is mostly preferred over a baseline $Λ$CDM (+$N_{\\rm eff}$) cosmology.

      "13        The <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> power spectrum has been strongly constrained by astronomical measurements at large scales, but only weakly at small scales.

In view of the measurements of the global 21-cm signal by the EDGES experiment, we explore the allowed parameter space of $m_s$, which describes the degree of deviation, by requiring the differential brightness temperature of the global 21-cm signal $δT_{21} \\le -50~\\rm mK$ at redshift $z=17$.\n",
      "14        Using Low Brightness Surface Galaxies (LBSG) rotational curves we inferred the free parameters of $\\ell$-boson stars as a <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> component. The $\\ell$-boson stars are numerical solutions to the non-relativistic limit of the Einstein-Klein-Gordon system, the Schrödinger-Poisson (SP) system. These solutions are parametrized by an angular momentum number $\\ell = (N-1)/2$ and an excitation number $n$. We perform a bayesian analysis by modifying the SimpleMC code to perform the parameter inference, for the cases with $\\ell = 0$, $\\ell = 1$ and multistates of $\\ell$-boson stars. We used the Akaike information criterion (AIC), Bayesian information criterion and the Bayes factor to compare the excited state ($\\ell$=1) and the multistate case with the ground state ($\\ell$=0) as the base model due to its simplicity. We found that the data in most galaxies in the sample favours the multistates case and that the scalar field mass tends to be slightly bigger than the ground state case.\n",
      "15        A long-standing observed curiosity of globular clusters (GCs) has been that both the number and total mass of GCs in a galaxy are linearly correlated with the galaxy&#39;s virial mass, whereas its stellar component shows no such linear correlation. This work expands on an empirical model for the numbers and ages of GCs in galaxies presented by Valenzuela et al. (2021) that is consistent with recent observational data from massive elliptical galaxies down to the dwarf galaxy regime. Applying the model to simulations, GC numbers are shown to be excellent tracers for the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> (DM) virial mass, even when distinct formation mechanisms are employed for blue and red GCs. Furthermore, the amount of DM smooth accretion is encoded in the GC abundances, therefore providing a measure for an otherwise nearly untraceable component of the formation history of galaxies.\n",
      "16        We analytically solve the problem of Bose star growth in the bath of gravitationally interacting particles. We find that after nucleation of this object, the bath is described by a self-similar solution of the kinetic equation, which is an attractor. Together with the conservation laws, this fixes mass evolution of the Bose star. Our results explain slowdown of the star growth at a certain &#34;core-halo&#34; mass, but also predict formation of the heavier and lighter objects in magistral <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> models.\n",
      "17        <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">Dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> subhaloes are key for the predictions of simulations of structure formation, but their existence frequently ends prematurely due to two technical issues, namely numerical disruption in N-body simulations and halo finders failing to identify them. Here we focus on the second issue, using the phase-space friends-of-friends halo finder ROCKSTAR as a benchmark (though we expect our results to translate to comparable codes). We confirm that the most prominent cause for losing track of subhaloes is tidal distortion rather than a low number of particles. As a solution, we present a flexible post-processing algorithm that tracks all subhalo particles over time, computes subhalo positions and masses based on those particles, and progressively removes stripped <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>. If a subhalo is lost by the halo finder, this algorithm keeps tracking its so-called ghost until it has almost no particles left or has truly merged with its host. We apply this technique to a large suite of N-body simulations and restore lost subhaloes to the halo catalogues, which has a dramatic effect on key summary statistics of large-scale structure. Specifically, the subhalo mass function increases by about 50% and the halo correlation function increases by a factor of two at small scales. While these quantitative results are somewhat specific to our algorithm, they demonstrate that particle tracking is a promising way to reliably follow haloes and reduce the need for orphan models. Our algorithm and augmented halo catalogues are publicly available.\n",
      "18        Ultralight bosons are predicted in many extensions to the Standard Model and are popular <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> candidates. The black hole superradiance mechanism allows for these particles to be probed using only their gravitational interaction. In this scenario, an ultralight boson cloud may form spontaneously around a spinning black hole and extract a non-negligible fraction of the black hole&#39;s mass. These oscillating clouds produce quasi-monochromatic, long-duration gravitational waves that may be detectable by ground-based or space-based gravitational wave detectors. We discuss the capability of a new long-duration signal tracking method, based on a hidden Markov model, to detect gravitational wave signals generated by ultralight vector boson clouds, including cases where the signal frequency evolution timescale is much shorter than that of a typical continuous wave signal. We quantify the detection horizon distances for vector boson clouds with current- and next-generation ground-based detectors. We demonstrate that vector clouds hosted by black holes with mass $\\gtrsim 60 M_{\\odot}$ and spin $\\gtrsim 0.6$ are within the reach of current-generation detectors up to a luminosity distance of $\\sim 1$ Gpc. This search method enables one to target vector boson clouds around remnant black holes from compact binary mergers detected by gravitational-wave detectors. We discuss the impact of the sky localization of the merger events and demonstrate that a typical remnant black hole reasonably well-localized by the current generation detector network is accessible in a follow-up search.\n",
      "19        Lithium-drifted silicon [Si(Li)] has been used for decades as an ionizing radiation detector in nuclear, particle, and astrophysical experiments, though such detectors have frequently been limited to small sizes (few cm$^2$) and cryogenic operating temperatures. The 10-cm-diameter Si(Li) detectors developed for the General Antiparticle Spectrometer (GAPS) balloon-borne <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> experiment are novel particularly for their requirements of low cost, large sensitive area (~10 m$^2$ for the full 1440-detector array), high temperatures (near -40$\\,^\\circ$C), and energy resolution below 4 keV FWHM for 20--100-keV x-rays. Previous works have discussed the manufacturing, passivation, and small-scale testing of prototype GAPS Si(Li) detectors. Here we show for the first time the results from detailed characterization of over 1100 flight detectors, illustrating the consistent intrinsic low-noise performance of a large sample of GAPS detectors. This work demonstrates the feasibility of large-area and low-cost Si(Li) detector arrays for next-generation astrophysics and nuclear physics applications.\n",

The boosted <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">Dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">Matter</span> flux at the edge of the Earth&#39;s atmosphere is expected to be pointing to the Galactic Center, with a flux 15 to 20 times larger than in the transverse direction.\n",
      "21        We investigate the reach of future gravitational wave (GW) detectors in probing inflaton couplings with visible sector particles that can either be bosonic or fermionic in nature. Assuming reheating takes place through perturbative quantum production from vacuum in presence of classical inflaton background field, we find that the spectral energy density of the primordial GW generated during inflation becomes sensitive to inflaton-<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> coupling. We conclude, obeying bounds from Big Bang Nucleosysthesis and Cosmic Microwave Background, that, e.g., inflaton-scalar couplings of the order of $\\sim\\mathcal{O}(10^{-20})$ GeV fall within the sensitivity range of several proposed GW detector facilities. However, this prediction is sensitive to the size of the inflationary scale, nature of the inflaton-<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> interaction and shape of the potential during reheating. Having found the time-dependent effective inflaton decay width, we also discuss its implications for <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> (DM) production from the thermal plasma via UV freeze-in during reheating. It is shown, that one can reproduce the observed DM abundance for its mass up to several PeVs, depending on the dimension of the operator connecting DM with the thermal bath and the associated scale of the UV physics. Thus we promote primordial GW to observables sensitive to feebly coupled inflaton, which is very challenging if not impossible to test in conventional particle physics laboratories or astrophysical measurements.\n",
      "22        We argue that demanding a consistent cosmological history, including the absence of domain walls and strongly interacting relics at the Peccei-Quinn scale, singles out two concrete realizations of hadronic QCD axions as viable <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> models. These realizations generally feature flavor-violating axion couplings to Standard Model quarks that are unsuppressed at low energies. As a consequence, experiments looking for flavor-violating hadronic processes involving the axion can be sensitive probes of QCD axion <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> models. In particular, we show that the NA62 and KOTO experiments could detect the $K\\rightarrowπ+ a$ decay for axions consistent with the observed <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> abundance via the post-inflationary misalignment mechanism.\n",
      "23        The mean <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> density within the turnaround radius, which is the boundary that separates a nonexpanding structure from the Hubble flow, was recently proposed as a novel cosmological probe. According to the spherical collapse model, the evolution with cosmic time of this turnaround density, $\\rm ρ_{ta}(z)$, can be used to determine both $\\rm Ω_m$ and $Ω_Λ$, independently of any other currently used probe. The properties of $\\rm ρ_{ta}$ predicted by the spherical collapse model were also shown to persist in the presence of full three-dimensional effects in $\\rm Λ$CDM N-body cosmological simulations when considering galaxy clusters at the present time, $z=0$. However, a small offset was discovered between the spherical-collapse prediction of the value of $ρ_{ta}$ at $z=0$ and its value measured in simulations. In this letter, we explore whether this offset evolves with cosmic time; whether it differs in different cosmologies; whether its origin can be confidently identified; and whether it can be corrected. We found that the offset does evolve slightly with redshift, and that it correlates strongly with the deviation from spherical symmetry of the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halo distribution inside and outside of the turnaround radius. We used an appropriate metric to quantify deviations in the environment of a structure from spherical symmetry. We found that using this metric, we can construct a sphericity-selected sample of halos for which the offset of $ρ_{ta}$ from the spherical collapse prediction is zero, independently of redshift and cosmology. We found that a sphericity-selected halo sample allows us to recover the simulated cosmology, and we conclude that the turnaround density evolution indeed encodes the cosmology in N-body simulations.\n",
      "24        We present a new suite of over 1,500 cosmological N-body simulations with varied Warm <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">Dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">Matter</span> (WDM) models ranging from 2.5 to 30 keV. We use these simulations to train Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to infer WDM particle masses from images of DM field data. Our fiducial setup can make accurate predictions of the WDM particle mass up to 7.5 keV at a 95% confidence level from small maps that cover an area of (25 h$^{-1}$ Mpc)$^2$. We vary the image resolution, simulation resolution, redshift, and cosmology of our fiducial setup to better understand how our model is making predictions. Using these variations, we find that our models are most dependent on simulation resolution, minimally dependent on image resolution, not systematically dependent on redshift, and robust to varied cosmologies. We also find that an important feature to distinguish between WDM models is present with a linear size between 100 and 200 h$^{-1}$ kpc. We compare our fiducial model to one trained on the power spectrum alone and find that our field-level model can make 2x more precise predictions and can make accurate predictions to 2x as massive WDM particle masses when used on the same data. Overall, we find that the field-level data can be used to accurately differentiate between WDM models and contain more information than is captured by the power spectrum. This technique can be extended to more complex DM models and opens up new opportunities to explore alternative DM models in a cosmological environment.\n",
      "25        The properties of globular clusters (GCs) contain valuable information of their host galaxies and <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span>-<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halos. In the remarkable example of ultra-diffuse galaxy, NGC5846-UDG1, the GC population exhibits strong radial mass segregation, indicative of dynamical-friction-driven orbital decay, which opens the possibility of using imaging data alone to constrain the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span>-<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> content of the galaxy. To explore this possibility, we develop a semi-analytical model of GC evolution, which starts from the initial mass function, the initial structure-mass relation, and the initial spatial distribution of the GC progenitors, and follows the effects of dynamical friction, tidal evolution, and two-body relaxation. Using Markov Chain Monte Carlo, we forward-model the GCs in a NGC5846-UDG1-like potential to match the observed GC mass, size, and spatial distributions, and to constrain the profile of the host halo and the origin of the GCs. We find that, with the assumptions of zero mass segregation when the star clusters were born, NGC5846-UDG1 is <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span>-<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> poor compared to what is expected from stellar-to-halo-mass relations, and its halo concentration is low, irrespective of having a cuspy or a cored halo profile. Its GC population has an initial spatial distribution more extended than the smooth stellar distribution. We discuss the results in the context of scaling laws of galaxy-halo connections, and warn against naively using the GC-abundance-halo-mass relation to infer the halo mass of UDGs. Our model is generally applicable to GC-rich dwarf galaxies, and is publicly available at https://github.com/JiangFangzhou/GCevo.\n",
      "26        The Epoch of Reionization (EoR) neutral Hydrogen (HI) 21-cm signal evolves significantly along the line-of-sight (LoS) due to the light-cone (LC) effect. It is important to accurately incorporate this in simulations in order to correctly interpret the signal. 21-cm LC simulations are typically produced by stitching together slices from a finite number $(N_{\\rm RS})$ of &#39;&#39;reionization snapshot&#39;&#39;, each corresponding to a different stage of reionization. In this paper, we have quantified the errors in the 21-cm LC simulation due to the finite value of $N_{\\rm RS}$. We show that this can introduce large discontinuities $(&gt; 200 \\%)$ at the stitching boundaries when $N_{\\rm RS}$ is small $(= 2,4)$ and the mean neutral fraction jumps by $δ\\bar{x}_{\\rm HI} = 0.2,0.1$ respectively at the stitching boundaries. This drops to $17 \\%$ for $N_{\\rm RS} = 13$ where $δ\\bar{x}_{\\rm HI}=0.02$. We present and also validate a method for mitigating this error by increasing $N_{\\rm RS}$ without a proportional increase in the computational costs which are mainly incurred in generating the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> and halo density fields. Our method generates these fields only at a few redshifts, and interpolates them to generate reionization snapshots at closely spaced redshifts. We use this to generate 21-cm LC simulations with $N_{\\rm RS} = 26,51,101$ and $201$, and show that the errors go down as $N_{\\rm RS}^{-1}$.\n",
      "27        The advent of gravitational wave astronomy has seen a huge influx of new predictions for potential discoveries of beyond the Standard Model fields. The coupling of all fundamental fields to gravity, together with its dominance on large scales, makes gravitational physics a rich laboratory to study fundamental physics. This holds especially true for the search for the elusive <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> photon, a promising <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> candidate. The <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> photon is predicted to generate instabilities in a rotating black hole spacetime, birthing a macroscopic Bose-Einstein condensate. These condensates can especially form around super massive black holes, modifying the dynamical inspiralling process. This then opens another window to leverage future space-borne gravitational wave antennas to join the hunt for the elusive <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> particle. This study builds a preliminary model for the gravitational waveform emitted by such a dressed extreme mass-ratio inspiral. Comparing these waveforms to the vacuum scenario allows projections to the potential constrainability on the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> photon mass by space-borne gravitational wave antennas. The superradiant instability of a massive vector field on a Kerr background is calculated and the modification to the dynamics of an inspiralling solar mass-scale compact object is determined with approximations on the backreaction effect of the cloud on the compact object. The end result is the projection that the LISA mission should be able to constrain the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> photon mass using extreme mass ratio inspirals in the range $[1.8 \\times 10^{-17}, 4.47 \\times 10^{-16}]$ eV.\n",
      "28        Recent observations made by the JWST have revealed a number of massive galaxies at high redshift ($z$). The presence of these galaxies appears at odds with the current $Λ$CDM cosmology. Here we investigate the possibility of alleviating the tension by incorporating uncertainties from three sources in counting massive galaxies at high $z$: cosmic variance, error in stellar mass estimate, and contribution by backsplash. We find that each of the sources can significantly increase the cumulative stellar mass density $ρ_*(&gt;M_*)$ at the high-mass end, and the combination of them can boost the density by more than one order of magnitude. Assuming a star formation efficiency of $ε_* \\sim 0.5$, cosmic variance alone can reduce the tension to $2σ$ level, except the most massive galaxy at $z=8$. Including in addition a lognormal dispersion with a width of 0.3 dex in the stellar mass can bring the observed stellar mass density at $z \\sim 7 - 10$ to the $2σ$ range of the cosmic variance. The tension is completely eliminated when gas stripped from backsplash halos is also taken into account. Our results highlight the importance of fully modeling uncertainties when interpreting observational data of rare objects. We use the constrained simulation, ELUCID, to investigate the descendants of high $z$ massive galaxies. We find that a significant portion of these galaxies end up in massive halos with mass $M_{\\rm halo} &gt; 10^{13} h^{-1}M_\\odot $ at $z=0$. A large fraction of central galaxies in $M_{\\rm halo} \\geqslant 10^{14.5} h^{-1}M_\\odot$ halos today are predicted to contain significant amounts of ancient stars formed in massive galaxies at $z\\sim 8$. This prediction can be tested by studying the structure and stellar population of central galaxies in present-day massive clusters.\n",
      "29        Within the $Λ$CDM cosmology, <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> haloes are comprised of both a smooth component and a population of smaller, gravitationally bound subhaloes. These components are often treated as a single halo when halo properties, such as density profiles, are extracted from simulations. Recent work has shown that density profiles change substantially when subhalo mass is excluded. In this paper, we expand on this result by analysing the change in three specific host halo properties -- concentration ($c_{\\rm{NFW}}$), spin ($λ_{\\rm Bullock}$), and shape ($c/a$), -- when calculated only from the smooth component of the halo. This analysis is performed on both Milky Way-mass haloes and cluster-mass haloes in high-resolution, zoom-in, $N$-body simulations. We find that when subhaloes are excluded the median value of (1) $c_{\\rm{NFW}}$ is enhanced by $\\approx 38 \\pm 12\\%$ and $\\approx 88 \\pm 7.7\\%$ for Milky Way mass ($10^{12.1}\\,\\text{M}_\\odot$) and cluster mass ($10^{14.8}\\,\\text{M}_\\odot$) haloes respectively, (2) $λ_{\\rm Bullock}$ is reduced for Milky Way mass by $\\approx 16 \\pm 6.8\\%$ and cluster mass haloes by $\\approx 32 \\pm 8.9\\%$. Additionally, with the removal of subhaloes, cluster mass haloes tend to become more spherical as the ratio of minor-to-major axis, $c/a$, increases by $\\approx 12 \\pm 4\\%$, whereas Milky Way mass haloes remain approximately the same shape with $c/a$ changed by $\\approx 1.2 \\pm 5.6\\%$. The fractional change of each of these properties depends primarily on the amount of mass that is removed from the halo system and, to a lesser extent, mass accretion history. Our findings demonstrate that the properties of the smooth components of <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> haloes are biased relative to the total mass of the halo including subhaloes.\n",
      "30        In order to test active galactic nucleus (AGN) unification and evolutionary models, we measured the AGN clustering properties as a function of AGN obscuration defined in terms of hydrogen column density, $N_{\\rm H}$. In addition to measuring the clustering of unobscured ($N_{\\rm H} &lt; 10^{22}\\,{\\rm cm}^{-2}$) and moderately obscured ($10^{22} \\leq N_{\\rm H} &lt; 10^{23.5}$) AGNs, we also targeted highly obscured sources ($N_{\\rm H}\\geq 10^{23.5}$) up to redshifts of $z=3$. We have compiled one of the largest samples of X-ray-selected AGNs from a total of eight deep XMM/Chandra surveys. We measured the clustering as a function of both AGN obscuration and redshift using the projected two-point correlation function, $w_{\\rm p}(r_{\\rm p})$. We modeled the large-scale clustering signal, measured the AGN bias, $b(z, N_{\\rm H})$, and interpreted it in terms of the typical AGN host <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halo, $M_{\\rm halo}(z, N_{\\rm H}$). We find no significant dependence of AGN clustering on obscuration, suggesting similar typical masses of the hosting halos as a function of $N_{\\rm H}$. This result matches expectations of AGN unification models, in which AGN obscuration depends mainly on the viewing angle of the obscuring torus. We measured, for the first time, the clustering of highly obscured AGNs and find that these objects reside in halos with typical mass $\\log M_{\\rm halo} = 12.98_{-0.22}^{+0.17} [h^{-1} M_\\odot]$ ($12.28_{-0.19}^{+0.13}$) at low $z \\sim 0.7$ (high $z \\sim 1.8$) redshifts. We find that irrespective of obscuration, an increase in AGN bias with redshift is slower than the expectation for a constant halo mass and instead follows the growth rate of halos, known as the passive evolution track. This implies that for those AGNs the clustering is mainly driven by the mass growth rate of the hosting halos and galaxies across cosmic time.\n",
      "31        Mergers between galaxy clusters are an important stage in the formation of the large-scale structure of the Universe. Some of the mergers show a spectacular bow shock that formed as a result of recent passage of a smaller cluster through a bigger one, the classic example of this being the so-called bullet cluster. In this paper, I describe ten examples of interacting clusters identified among 200 of the most massive objects, with total masses above $1.4 \\times 10^{14}$ M$_{\\odot}$, from the IllustrisTNG300 simulation by searching for prominent bow shocks in their temperature maps. Despite different mass ratios of the two merging clusters, the events are remarkably similar in many respects. In all cases, the companion cluster passed close to the main one only once, between 0.9 and 0.3 Gyr ago, with the pericenter distance of 100-530 kpc and a velocity of up to 3400 km s$^{-1}$. The subcluster, typically an order of magnitude smaller in mass than the main cluster before the interaction, loses most of its <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> and gas in the process. The displacement between the collisionless part of the remnant and the bow shock is such that the remnant typically lags behind the shock or coincides with it, with a single exception of the merger occurring with the largest velocity. Usually about 1% of the gas cells in the merging clusters are shocked, and the median Mach numbers of these gas cells are around two. Due to the relatively small size of the simulation box, no close analog of the bullet cluster was found, but I identified one case that is similar in terms of mass, velocity, and displacement. The presented cases bear more resemblance to less extreme observed interacting clusters such as A520 and Coma.\n",
      "32        Microscopic horizonless relics could form in the early universe either directly through gravitational collapse or as stable remnants of the Hawking evaporation of primordial black holes. In both cases they completely or partially evade cosmological constraints arising from Hawking evaporation and in certain mass ranges can explain the entirety of the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>. We systematically explore the stochastic gravitational-wave background associated with the formation of microscopic <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span>-<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> relics in various scenarios, adopting an agnostic approach and discussing the limitations introduced by existing constraints, possible ways to circumvent the latter, and expected astrophysical foregrounds.

      "33        In direct <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> (DM) detection via scattering off the electrons, the momentum transfer plays a crucial role. Previous work showed that for self-interacting DM, if the DM particle has a size (the so-called puffy DM), the radius effect could dominate the momentum transfer and become another source of velocity dependence for self-scattering cross section. In this work we investigate the direct detection of puffy DM particles with different radii through electron recoil. We find that comparing with the available experimental exclusion limits dominated by the mediator effect for XENON10, XENON100 and XENON1T, the constraints on the puffy DM-electron scattering cross-section become much weaker for large radius DM particles. For small-radius DM particles, the constraints remain similar to the point-like DM case.\n",
      "34        Boson stars are gravitationally bound objects that arise in ultralight <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> models and form in the centers of galactic halos or axion miniclusters. We systematically study the excitations of a boson star, taking into account the mixing between positive and negative frequencies introduced by gravity. We show that the spectrum contains zero-energy modes in the monopole and dipole sectors resulting from spontaneous symmetry breaking by the boson star background. We analyze the general properties of the eigenmodes and derive their orthogonality and completeness conditions which have non-standard form due to the positive-negative frequency mixing. The eigenvalue problem is solved numerically for the first few energy levels in different multipole sectors and the results are compared to the solutions of the Schrödinger equation in fixed boson star gravitational potential. The two solutions differ significantly for the lowest modes, but get close for higher levels. We further confirm the normal mode spectrum in 3D wave simulations where we inject perturbations with different multipoles. As an application of the normal mode solutions, we compute the matrix element entering the evaporation rate of a boson star immersed in a hot axion gas. The computation combines the use of exact wavefunctions for the low-lying bound states and of the Schrödinger approximation for the high-energy excitations.\n",
      "35        If long-range attractive forces exist and are stronger than gravity then cosmic halo formation can begin in the radiation-dominated era. We study a simple realization of this effect in a system where <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> fermions have Yukawa interactions mediated by scalar particles, analogous to the Higgs boson in the standard model. We develop a self-consistent description of the system including exact background dynamics of the scalar field, and precise modelling of the fermion density fluctuations. For the latter, we provide accurate approximations for the linear growth as well as quantitative modelling of the nonlinear evolution using N-body simulations. We find that halo formation occurs exponentially fast and on scales substantially larger than simple estimates predict. The final fate of these halos remains uncertain, but could be annihilation, <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> stars, primordial black holes, or even the existence of galaxy-sized halos at <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>-radiation equality. More generally, our results demonstrate the importance of mapping scalar-mediated interactions onto structure formation outcomes and constraints for beyond the standard model theories.\n",
      "36        Recent analysis on the stellar kinematics of ultra-faint dwarf (UFD) galaxies has put a stringent upper limit on the self-scattering cross section of <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>, i.e., $σ/m&lt;{\\cal O}(0.1)\\,{\\rm cm^2/g}$ at the scattering velocity of ${\\cal O}(10)\\,{\\rm km/s}$. Resonant self-interacting <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> (rSIDM) is one possibility that can be consistent with the UFDs and explain the low central densities of rotation-supported galaxies; the cross section is resonantly enhanced to be $σ/m = {\\cal O}(1)\\,{\\rm cm^2/g}$ around the scattering velocity of ${\\cal O}(100)\\,{\\rm km/s}$ while being suppressed at lower velocities. To further assess this possibility, since the inferred <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> distribution of halos from astrophysical observations is usually compared to that in constant-cross section SIDM (cSIDM), whether the structures of rSIDM halos can be approximated by the cSIDM halo profiles needs to be clarified. In this work, we employ the grovothermal fluid method to investigate the structural evolution of rSIDM halos in a wide mass range. We find that except for halos in a specific mass range, the present structures of rSIDM halos are virtually indistinguishable from those of the cSIDM halos. For halos in the specific mass range, the resonant self-scattering renders a break in their density profile. We demonstrate how such a density-profile break appears in astrophysical observations, e.g., rotation curves and line-of-sight velocity dispersion profiles. We show that for halos above the specific mass range, the density-profile break thermalizes to disappear before the present. We demonstrate that such distinctive thermalization dynamics can leave imprints on the orbital classes of stars with similar ages and metallicities.\n",
      "37        The E-type $α$-attractor models of single-field inflation were generalized further in order to accommodate production of primordial black holes (PBH) via adding a near-inflection point to the inflaton scalar potential at smaller scales, in good agreement with measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation. A minimal number of new parameters was used but their fine-tuning was maximized in order to increase possible masses of PBH formed during an ultra-slow-roll phase leading to a large enhancement of the power spectrum of scalar (curvature) perturbations by 6 or 7 orders of magnitude against the power spectrum of perturbations observed in CMB. It was found that extreme fine-tuning of the parameters in our models can lead to a formation of the Earth-size PBH with the masses of approximately $10^{27}$ g, still in agreement with CMB observations. Quantum corrections are known to lead to the perturbative upper bound on the amplitude of large scalar perturbations responsible for PBH production. The quantum (one-loop) corrections in our models were found to be suppressed by one order of magnitude for PBH with the masses of approximately $10^{19}$ g, which may form the whole <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> in the Universe.\n",

We then study possible signals of type-II majoron DM and the present and expected constraints on the parameter space that can be obtained from cosmological observations, direct detection experiments, and present and future searches for decaying DM at neutrino telescopes and cosmic-ray experiments. We find that -- depending on the majoron mass, the production mechanism, and the value of the vacuum expectation value of the type-II triplet -- all of the three decay modes (photons, electrons, neutrinos) of majoron DM particles can yield observable signals at future indirect searches for DM. Furthermore, in a corner of the parameter space, detection of majoron DM is possible through electron recoil at running and future direct detection experiments.\n",
      "39        Running vacuum models and viscous <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> scenarios beyond perfect fluid idealization are two appealing theoretical strategies that have been separately studied as alternatives to solve some problems rooted in the $Λ$CDM cosmological model. In this paper, we combine these two notions in a single cosmological setting and investigate their cosmological implications, paying particular attention in the interplay between these two constituents in different cosmological periods. Specifically, we consider a well-studied running vacuum model inspired by renormalization group, and a recently proposed general parameterization for the bulk viscosity $ξ$. By employing dynamical system analysis, we explore the physical aspects of the new phase space that emerges from the combined models and derive stability conditions that ensure complete cosmological dynamics. We identify four distinct classes of models and find that the critical points of the phase space are non-trivially renewed compared to the single scenarios. We then proceed, in a joint and complementary way to the dynamical system analysis, with a detailed numerical exploration to quantify the impact of both the running parameter and the bulk viscosity coefficient on the cosmological evolution. Thus, for some values of the model parameters, numerical solutions show qualitative differences from the $Λ$CDM model, which is phenomenologically appealing in light of cosmological observations.\n",
      "40        The intrinsic alignment (IA) of observed galaxy shapes with the underlying cosmic web is a source of contamination in weak lensing surveys. Sensitive methods to identify the IA signal will therefore need to be included in the upcoming weak lensing analysis pipelines. Hydrodynamical cosmological simulations allow us to directly measure the intrinsic ellipticities of galaxies and thus provide a powerful approach to predict and understand the IA signal. Here we employ the novel, large-volume hydrodynamical simulation MTNG740, a product of the MillenniumTNG (MTNG) project, to study the IA of galaxies. We measure the projected correlation functions between the intrinsic shape/shear of galaxies and various tracers of large-scale structure, $w_{+g},\\ w_{+m},\\ w_{++}$ over the radial range $r_{\\rm p} \\in [0.02 , 200]\\,h^{-1}{\\rm Mpc}$ and at redshifts $z=0.0$, $0.5$ and $1.0$. We detect significant signal-to-noise IA signals with the density field for both elliptical and spiral galaxies. We also find significant intrinsic shear-shear correlations for ellipticals. We further examine correlations of the intrinsic shape of galaxies with the local tidal field. Here we find a significant IA signal for elliptical galaxies assuming a linear model. We also detect a weak IA signal for spiral galaxies under a quadratic tidal torquing model. Lastly, we measure the alignment between central galaxies and their host <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span>-<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halos, finding small to moderate misalignments between their principal axes that decline with halo mass.\n",
      "41        We study weak gravitational lensing convergence maps produced from the MillenniumTNG (MTNG) simulations by direct projection of the mass distribution on the past backwards lightcone of a fiducial observer. We explore the lensing maps over a large dynamic range in simulation mass and angular resolution, allowing us to establish a clear assessment of numerical convergence. By comparing full physics hydrodynamical simulations with corresponding <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span>-<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>-only runs we quantify the impact of baryonic physics on the most important weak lensing statistics. Likewise, we predict the impact of massive neutrinos reliably far into the non-linear regime. We also demonstrate that the &#34;fixed &amp; paired&#34; variance suppression technique increases the statistical robustness of the simulation predictions on large scales not only for time slices but also for continuously output lightcone data. We find that both baryonic and neutrino effects substantially impact weak lensing shear measurements, with the latter dominating over the former on large angular scales. Thus, both effects must explicitly be included to obtain sufficiently accurate predictions for stage IV lensing surveys. Reassuringly, our results agree accurately with other simulation results where available, supporting the promise of simulation modelling for precision cosmology far into the non-linear regime.\n",
      "42        An era of kination occurs when the Universe&#39;s energy density is dominated by a fast-rolling scalar field. <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">Dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> that is thermally produced during an era of kination requires larger-than-canonical annihilation cross sections to generate the observed <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> relic abundance. Furthermore, <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> density perturbations that enter the horizon during an era of kination grow linearly with the scale factor prior to radiation domination. We show how the resulting enhancement to the small-scale <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> power spectrum increases the microhalo abundance and boosts the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> annihilation rate. We then use gamma-ray observations to constrain thermal <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> production during kination. The annihilation boost factor depends on the minimum halo mass, which is determined by the small-scale cutoff in the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> power spectrum. Therefore, observational limits on the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> annihilation rate imply a minimum cutoff scale for a given <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> particle mass and kination scenario. For <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> that was once in thermal equilibrium with the Standard Model, this constraint establishes a maximum allowed kinetic decoupling temperature for the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>. This bound on the decoupling temperature implies that the growth of perturbations during kination cannot appreciably boost the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> annihilation rate if <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> was once in thermal equilibrium with the Standard Model.\n",
      "43        We present the measurement of total and stellar/<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> decomposed mass density profile around a sample of galaxy groups and clusters with dynamical masses derived from integral-field stellar kinematics from the MaNGA survey in Paper~I and weak lensing derived from the DECaLS imaging survey. Combining the two data sets enables accurate measurement of the radial density distribution from several kpc to Mpc scales. Intriguingly, we find that the excess surface density derived from stellar kinematics in the inner region cannot be explained by simply adding an NFW <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halo extrapolated from lensing measurement at a larger scale to a stellar mass component derived from the NASA-Sloan Atlas (NSA) catalog. We find that a good fit to both data sets requires a stellar mass normalization about 3 times higher than that derived from the NSA catalog, which would require an unrealistically too-heavy initial mass function for stellar mass estimation. If we keep the stellar mass normalization to that of the NSA catalog but allow a varying inner <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> density profile, we obtain an asymptotic slope of $γ_{\\rm gnfw}$= $1.82_{-0.25}^{+0.15}$, $γ_{\\rm gnfw}$= $1.48_{-0.41}^{+0.20}$ for the group bin and the cluster bin respectively, significantly steeper than the NFW case. We also compare the total mass inner density slopes with those from Illustris-TNG300 and find that the values from the simulation are lower than the observation by at least $3σ$ level.\n",
      "44        We present dynamical scaling relations, combined with the stellar population properties, for a subsample of about 6000 nearby galaxies with the most reliable dynamical models extracted from the full MaNGA sample of 10K galaxies. We show that the inclination-corrected mass plane (MP) for both early-type galaxies (ETGs) and late-type galaxies (LTGs), which links dynamical mass, projected half-light radius $R_{\\rm e}$, and the second stellar velocity moment $σ_{\\rm e}$ within $R_{\\rm e}$, satisfies the virial theorem and is even tighter than the uncorrected one. We find a clear parabolic relation between $\\lg(M/L)(&lt;R_{\\rm e})$, the total mass-to-light ratio within a sphere of radius $R_{\\rm e}$, and $\\lgσ_{\\rm e}$, with the $M/L$ increasing with $σ_{\\rm e}$ and for older stellar populations. However, the relation for ETGs is linear and the one for the youngest galaxies is constant. We confirm and improve the relation between average logarithmic total density slopes $γ_{_{\\rm T}}$ and $σ_{\\rm e}$: $γ_{_{\\rm T}}$ become steeper with increasing $σ_{\\rm e}$ until $\\lg(σ_{\\rm e}/{\\rm km\\,s^{-1}})\\approx 2.2$ and then remain constant around $γ_{_{\\rm T}}\\approx -2.2$. The $γ_{_{\\rm T}}-σ_{\\rm e}$ variation is larger for LTGs than ETGs. At fixed $σ_{\\rm e}$ the total density profiles steepen with galaxy age and for ETGs. We find generally low <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> fractions, median $f_{\\rm DM}(&lt;R_{\\rm e})=8$ per cent, within a sphere of radius $R_{\\rm e}$. However, we find that $f_{\\rm DM}(&lt;R_{\\rm e})$ depends on $σ_{\\rm e}$ better than stellar mass: <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> increases to a median $f_{\\rm DM}=33$ percent for galaxies with $σ_{\\rm e}\\lesssim100{\\rm km\\,s^{-1}}$. The increased $f_{\\rm DM}(&lt;R_{\\rm e})$ at low $σ_{\\rm e}$ explains the parabolic $\\lg(M/L)(&lt;R_{\\rm e})-\\lgσ_{\\rm e}$ relation.\n",
      "45        We analyze the global stellar population, radial gradients and non-parametric star formation history of $\\sim 10$K galaxies from the MaNGA Survey final data release 17 (DR17), based on stellar population synthesis and full-spectrum fitting, and relate them with dynamical properties of galaxies. We confirm that stellar population correlates with stellar velocity dispersion $σ_{\\rm e}$ better than with stellar mass $M_{\\ast}$, but also find that younger galaxies are more metal-poor at fixed $σ_{\\rm e}$. Stellar age, metallicity, and mass-to-light ratio $M_{\\ast}/L$ all decrease with galaxy rotation, while radial gradients become more negative (i.e., younger, more metal-poor, and lower $M_{\\ast}/L$ in the outskirts). The trend between metallicity gradients and rotation reverses for slow rotators, which stand out for their more negative metallicity gradients than faster-rotating galaxies. We highlight a population of massive disk galaxies on the green valley, on the $(σ_{\\rm e},\\rm Age)$ plane, that show steep negative age and metallicity gradients, consistent with their old central bulges surrounded by young star-forming disks and metal-poor gas accretion. Galaxies with high $σ_{\\rm e}$, steep total mass-density slope, low <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> fraction, high $M_{\\ast}/L$, and high metallicity have the highest star-formation rate at earlier times, and are currently quenched. We discover a population of low-mass star-forming galaxies with low rotation but physically distinct from the massive slow rotators. A catalogue of the population properties is provided publicly.\n",
      "46        This is the first paper in our series on the combined analysis of the Dynamics and stellar Population (DynPop) for the MaNGA survey in the final SDSS Data Release 17 (DR17). Here we present a catalogue of dynamically-determined quantities for over 10000 nearby galaxies based on integral-field stellar kinematics from the MaNGA survey. The dynamical properties are extracted using the axisymmetric Jeans Anisotropic Modelling (JAM) method, which was previously shown to be the most accurate for this kind of study. We assess systematic uncertainties using eight dynamical models with different assumptions. We use two orientations of the velocity ellipsoid: either cylindrically-aligned JAM$_{\\rm cyl}$ or spherically-aligned JAM$_{\\rm sph}$. We also make four assumptions for the models&#39; <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> vs. luminous <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> distributions: (1) mass-follows-light, (2) free NFW <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> halo, (3) cosmologically-constrained NFW halo, (4) generalized NFW <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> halo, i.e. with free inner slope. In this catalogue, we provide the quantities related to the mass distributions (e.g. the density slopes and enclosed mass within a sphere of a given radius for total mass, stellar mass, and <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> mass components). We also provide the complete models which can be used to compute the full luminous and mass distribution of each galaxy. Additionally, we visually assess the qualities of the models to help with model selections. We estimate the observed scatter in the measured quantities which decreases as expected with improvements in quality. For the best data quality, we find a remarkable consistency of measured quantities between different models, highlighting the robustness of the results.\n",
      "47        What is the highest energy at which gravitons can be observed? We address this question by studying graviton-to-photon conversion - the inverse-Gertsenshtein effect - in the magnetic field of the Milky Way. We find that above $\\sim 1~\\mbox{PeV}$ the effective photon mass grows large enough to quench the conversion rate. The induced photon flux is comparable to the sensitivity of LHAASO to a diffuse $γ$-ray background, but only for graviton abundances of order $Ω_{\\text{gw}} h^2_0 \\sim 1$. In the future, owing to a better understanding of $γ$-ray backgrounds, larger effective areas and longer observation times, sub-PeV shimmering gravitons with a realistic abundance of $Ω_{\\text{gw}} h^2_0 \\sim 0.01$ could be detected. We show that this is achieved in a cosmologically-motivated scenario of post-recombination superheavy <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> decay. Therefore, the sub-PeV range might be the ultimate energy frontier at which gravitons can be observed.\n",
      "48        The relation between the total mass contained in the globular clusters of a galaxy and the mass of its <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halo has been found observationally to be nearly linear over five decades of mass. However, the high-mass end of this relation is not well determined from previous data and shows large scatter. We analyze the globular cluster systems (GCSs) of a homogeneous sample of 11 brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) through DOLPHOT photometry of their deep Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images in the F814W filter. We standardize the definition of $M_{GCS}$, the total GCS mass, by using the GC total population within a limiting radius of $0.1 R_{virial}$, while the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span>-<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halo mass $M_h$ is determined from the weak-lensing calibration of $M_h$ versus $M_{bary}$. When these 11 BCGs are added to the previously studied homogeneous catalogue of Virgo member galaxies, a total value for $η= M_{GCS}/M_h$ is found to be $(3.0\\pm1.8_{internal})\\times10^{-5}$, slightly higher than previous estimates but with much reduced uncertainty. Perhaps more importantly, the results suggest that the relation continues to have a near-linear shape at the highest galaxy masses, strongly reinforcing the conclusion that accreted GCs make a major contribution to the GC populations at high galaxy mass.\n",
      "49        We introduce an analytic surface density profile for <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halos that accurately reproduces the structure of simulated halos of mass $M_{\\rm vir} = 10^{7-11}\\ M_\\odot$, making it useful for modeling line-of-sight perturbers in strong gravitational lensing models. The two-parameter function has an analytic deflection potential and is more accurate than the projected Navarro, Frenk &amp; White (NFW) profile commonly adopted at this mass scale for perturbers, especially at the small radii of most relevant for lensing perturbations. Using a characteristic radius, $R_{-1}$, where the log slope of surface density is equal to $-1$, and an associated surface density, $Σ_{-1}$, we can represent the expected lensing signal from line-of-sight halos statistically, for an ensemble of halo orientations, using a distribution of {\\em projected concentration} parameters, $\\mathcal{C}_{\\rm vir} := r_{\\rm vir}/ R_{-1}$. Though an individual halo can have a projected concentration that varies with orientation with respect to the observer, the range of projected concentrations correlates with the usual three-dimensional halo concentration in a way that enables ease of use.\n",
      "50        Axions and axion-like particles (ALPs) are a prominent <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> candidate, drawing motivation in part from the axiverse of string theory. Axion-like particles can also arise as composite degrees of freedom of a <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> sector, for example, as <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> pions in <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> Quantum Chromo-Dynamics. In a <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> Standard Model (SM) wherein all 6 quark flavors are light while the photon is massive, one finds a rich low-energy spectrum of stable and ultralight particles, in the form of neutral and charged <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> scalars, and complex neutral scalars analogous to the SM kaon, with mass splittings determined by the mass and charge of the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> quarks. The model finds a natural portal to the visible sector via kinetic coupling of the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> and visible photons, and consequent millicharges for <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>. The <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> can be a mixture of all these ultralight bosonic degrees of freedom, and exhibit both parity-even and parity-odd interactions, making the theory testable at a wide variety of experiments.

      "51        The most luminous quasars at $z &gt; 6$ are suspected to be both highly clustered and reside in the most massive <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halos in the early Universe, making them prime targets to search for galaxy overdensities and/or protoclusters. We search for Lyman-break dropout-selected galaxies using HST WFC3/ACS broadband imaging in the fields of three $6 &lt; z &lt; 7$ quasars, as well as their simultaneously observed coordinated-parallel fields, and constrain their photometric redshifts using EAZY. One field, J0305-3150, shows a volume density 10$\\times$ higher than the blank-field UV luminosity function (UVLF) at M$_{UV} &lt; -20$, with tentative evidence of a 3$σ$ overdensity in its parallel field located 15 cMpc away. Another field, J2054-0005, shows an angular overdensity within 500 ckpc from the quasar but still consistent with UVLF predictions within 3$σ$, while the last field, J2348-3054, shows no enhancement. We discuss methods for reducing uncertainty in overdensity measurements when using photometric selection and show that we can robustly select LBGs consistent with being physically associated with the quasar, corroborated by existing JWST/NIRCam WFSS data in the J0305 field. Even accounting for incompleteness, the overdensities in J0305 and J2054 are higher for brighter galaxies at short angular separations, suggesting preferential enhancement of more massive galaxies in the immediate vicinity of the quasar. Finally, we compare the LBG population with previously-identified [CII] and mm-continuum companions; the LBG overdensities are not accompanied by an enhanced number of dusty galaxies, suggesting that the overdense quasar fields are not in the bursty star-forming phase sometimes seen in high-redshift protoclusters.\n"

The effects of DM on NS properties, including the mass-radius relation, the moment of inertia, and tidal deformability, are calculated by varying its fraction. The study found that the EOS becomes softer with increasing DM momentum, and the DM has marginal effects on nuclear <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> properties, except for the EOSs and binding energy per particle. The study also calculated the properties of isolated, static, and rotating DM admixed NS and found that the DM has significant effects on both static and rotating NS. We have also observed that a tiny amount of DM can accumulate inside the NS, and more amount of it makes the NS unstable. The study also suggests that the secondary component might be a NS with DM content if the underlying nuclear EOS is sufficiently stiff. The $f$-mode oscillations of the DM admixed hyperon stars are calculated and found that there exist a correlation between canonical $f$-mode frequency and the dimensionless tidal deformability parameter ($Λ_{1.4}$) and we have put a constraint on $f$-mode frequency using GW170817 data. Finally, we have calculated the DM admixed binary NS properties and found that the binary system becomes less deformed and sustains more time in its inspiral phases with the addition of DM. Therefore, we suggest that one can take DM inside the compact objects while modeling the inspiral waveforms for the BNS systems.\n",
      "3        Radiative emissions from electrons and positrons generated by <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> (DM) annihilation or decay are one of the most investigated signals in indirect searches of WIMPs. Ideal targets must have large ratio of DM to baryonic <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>. However, such ``<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span>&#39;&#39; systems have a poorly known level of magnetic turbulence, which determines the residence time of the electrons and positrons and therefore also the strength of the expected signal. This typically leads to significant uncertainties in the derived DM bounds. In a novel approach, we compute the self-confinement of the DM-induced electrons and positrons. Indeed, they themselves generate irregularities in the magnetic field, thus setting a lower limit on the presence of the magnetic turbulence. We specifically apply this approach to dwarf spheroidal galaxies. Finally, by comparing the expected synchrotron emission with radio data from the direction of the Draco galaxy collected at the Giant Metre Radio Telescope, we show that the proposed approach can be used to set robust and competitive bounds on WIMP DM.\n",
      "4        The particle origin of <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> (DM) is still one of the main puzzles in modern physics. One of the most promising search strategy to detect DM at laboratories is through the indirect search of cosmic particles that are produced from DM annihilation in space. In particular, the flux of cosmic positrons has been measured with high precision by the AMS-02 experiment demonstrating that an excess above 10 GeV, with respect to the secondary production, is present. We study in this paper the possible DM origin of the positron excess finding the values of the DM mass $M$ and annihilation cross section $\\langle σv \\rangle$ that are needed to fit high-energy positron data. In particular, we find that for DM annihilating into $b\\bar{b}$ it is required to have $M=43$ TeV and $\\langle σv \\rangle = 10^{-21}$ cm$^3$/s while for $τ^+τ^-$ $M=2$ TeV and $\\langle σv \\rangle = 3\\times 10^{-23}$ cm$^3$/s. If DM produce positrons, they are expected to generate gamma rays from the center of the Milky Way and around dwarf galaxy satellites of the Galaxy. We thus combine the values for the DM mass and annihilation cross section obtained with the fit to AMS-02 positron data with the upper limits derived with the non-detection of $γ$ rays with HESS in the direction of the Galactic center and Fermi-LAT for the combined analysis of dwarf galaxies. The main result of the paper is that only DM annihilating into $μ^+ μ^-$ with a mass around 500 GeV and $\\langle σv \\rangle = 4\\times 10^{-24}$ cm$^3$/s can fit AMS-02 data and be compatible with the upper limits found with $γ$ rays. As for the $τ^+ τ^-$ ($b\\bar{b}$) channel, DM can contribute at most at a few tens $\\%$ (a few \\%) level.\n",

      "6        Numerous observations suggest that there exist undiscovered beyond-the-Standard-Model particles and fields. Because of their unknown nature, these exotic particles and fields could interact with Standard Model particles in many different ways and assume a variety of possible configurations. Here we present an overview of the Global Network of Optical Magnetometers for Exotic physics searches (GNOME), our ongoing experimental program designed to test a wide range of exotic physics scenarios. The GNOME experiment utilizes a worldwide network of shielded atomic magnetometers (and, more recently, comagnetometers) to search for spatially and temporally correlated signals due to torques on atomic spins from exotic fields of astrophysical origin.

      "7        Recent observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) are yielding tantalizing hints of an early population of massive, bright galaxies at $z &gt; 10$, with Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) observations indicating significant dust masses in place as early as $z\\sim 7$. To understand the implications of these observations, we use the DELPHI semi-analytic model that jointly tracks the assembly of <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halos and their constituent baryons, including the key processes of dust enrichment. Our model employs only two redshift- and mass-independent free parameters that are tuned against all available galaxy data at $z \\sim 5-9$ before it is used to make predictions up to $z \\sim 20$. Our key results are: (1) the model progressively under-predicts the observed ultraviolet luminosity function (UV LF) at $z &gt; 12$; observations at $z&gt;16$ lie close to, or even above, a &#34;maximal&#34; model where all available gas is turned into stars; (2) UV selection would miss 34% of the star formation rate density at $z \\sim 5$, decreasing to 17% by $z \\sim 10$ for bright galaxies with $\\rm{M_{UV}} &lt; -19$; (3) the dust mass ($M_d$) evolves with the stellar mass ($M_*$) and redshift as $\\log(M_d) = 1.194\\log(M_*) + 0.0975z - 5.433$; (4) the escape fraction of UV photons ($f_{\\rm esc}^{\\rm UV}$) decreases with increasing mass and star formation rate.

Finally, we predict the far infrared (FIR) LF at $z \\sim 5-20$, testable with ALMA observations, and caution that spectroscopic redshifts and dust masses must be pinned down before invoking unphysical extrema in galaxy formation models.\n",
      "8        We reexamine the consequences of perturbative unitarity on <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> freeze-out when both Sommerfeld enhancement and bound state formation affect <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> annihilations. At leading order (LO) the annihilation cross-section is infrared dominated and the connection between the unitarity bound and the upper bound on the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> mass depends only on how the different partial waves are populated. We compute how this picture is modified at next-to-leading order (NLO) with the goal of assigning a reliable theory uncertainty to the freeze-out predictions. We explicitly compute NLO corrections in a simple model with abelian gauge interactions and provide an estimate of the theoretical uncertainty for the thermal masses of heavy electroweak $n$-plets. Along the way, we clarify the regularization and matching procedure necessary to deal with singular potentials in quantum mechanics with a calculable relativistic UV completion.\n",
      "9        We provide an algorithm for evolving general spin-$s$ Gross-Pitaevskii / non-linear Schrödinger systems carrying a variety of interactions, where the $2s+1$ components of the `spinor&#39; field represent the different spin-multiplicity states. We consider many nonrelativistic interactions up to quartic order in the Schrödinger field (both short and long-range, and spin-dependent and spin-independent interactions), including explicit spin-orbit couplings. The algorithm allows for spatially varying external and/or self-generated vector potentials that couple to the spin density of the field. Our work can be used for scenarios ranging from laboratory systems such as spinor Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs), to cosmological/astrophysical systems such as self-interacting bosonic <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>. As examples, we provide results for two different setups of spin-$1$ BECs that employ a varying magnetic field and spin-orbit coupling, respectively, and also collisions of spin-$1$ solitons in <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>. Our symplectic algorithm is second-order accurate in time, and is extensible to the known higher-order accurate methods.\n",
      "10        We discuss the production of primordial black holes in an early <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> dominated era, which typically takes place in string inspired early universe cosmological models. In particular, we consider a pre-big bang scenario (extending previous results regarding formation in the radiation dominated era) where the enhancement of curvature perturbations is induced by a variation of the sound-speed parameter c_s during the string phase of high-curvature inflation. After imposing all relevant observational constraints, we find that the considered class of models is compatible with the production of a large amount of primordial black holes, in the mass range relevant to <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>, only for a small range of the parameters space. On the other hand, we find that a huge production of light primordial black holes may occur both in such <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> dominated era and in the radiation dominated one.\n",
      "11        We explore an extension of the standard $Λ$CDM model by including an interaction between neutrinos and <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>, and making use of the ground based telescope data of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT). An indication for a non-zero coupling between <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> and neutrinos (both assuming a temperature independent and $T^2$ dependent cross-section) is obtained at the 1$σ$ level coming from the ACT CMB data alone and when combined with the Planck CMB and Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) measurements. This result is confirmed by both fixing the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom in the early Universe to the Standard Model value of $N_{\\rm eff}=3.044$, and allowing $N_{\\rm eff}$ to be a free cosmological parameter. Furthermore, when performing a Bayesian model comparison, the interacting $ν$DM (+$N_{\\rm eff}$) scenario is mostly preferred over a baseline $Λ$CDM (+$N_{\\rm eff}$) cosmology. The preferred value is then used as a benchmark and the potential implications of <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter&#39;s</span> interaction with a sterile neutrino are discussed.\n",
      "12        We present an innovative approach to constraining the non-cold <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> model using a convolutional neural network (CNN).

Our proposed method complements the traditional power spectrum analysis. We compare our CNN classification results with those from the power spectrum of the differential brightness temperature map of 21cm radiation, and find that the CNN outperforms the latter. Moreover, we investigate the impact of baryonic physics on the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> model constraint, including star formation, self-shielding of HI gas, and UV background model. We find that these effects may introduce some contamination in the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> constraint, but they are insignificant when compared to the realistic system noise of the SKA instruments.\n",
      "13        The <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> power spectrum has been strongly constrained by astronomical measurements at large scales, but only weakly at small scales. Compared with the standard scenario, the deviation of the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> power spectrum at small scales has influence on the cosmological structure formation, e.g., the comoving number density of <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halos. The thermal history of the intergalactic medium (IGM) can be changed if <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> is made of weakly interacting massive particles and can annihilate into standard model particles. The changes of the evolution of IGM could leave imprints on the relevant astronomical observations.

In view of the measurements of the global 21-cm signal by the EDGES experiment, we explore the allowed parameter space of $m_s$, which describes the degree of deviation, by requiring the differential brightness temperature of the global 21-cm signal $δT_{21} \\le -50~\\rm mK$ at redshift $z=17$.\n",
      "14        Using Low Brightness Surface Galaxies (LBSG) rotational curves we inferred the free parameters of $\\ell$-boson stars as a <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> component. The $\\ell$-boson stars are numerical solutions to the non-relativistic limit of the Einstein-Klein-Gordon system, the Schrödinger-Poisson (SP) system. These solutions are parametrized by an angular momentum number $\\ell = (N-1)/2$ and an excitation number $n$. We perform a bayesian analysis by modifying the SimpleMC code to perform the parameter inference, for the cases with $\\ell = 0$, $\\ell = 1$ and multistates of $\\ell$-boson stars. We used the Akaike information criterion (AIC), Bayesian information criterion and the Bayes factor to compare the excited state ($\\ell$=1) and the multistate case with the ground state ($\\ell$=0) as the base model due to its simplicity. We found that the data in most galaxies in the sample favours the multistates case and that the scalar field mass tends to be slightly bigger than the ground state case.\n",
      "15        A long-standing observed curiosity of globular clusters (GCs) has been that both the number and total mass of GCs in a galaxy are linearly correlated with the galaxy&#39;s virial mass, whereas its stellar component shows no such linear correlation. This work expands on an empirical model for the numbers and ages of GCs in galaxies presented by Valenzuela et al. (2021) that is consistent with recent observational data from massive elliptical galaxies down to the dwarf galaxy regime. Applying the model to simulations, GC numbers are shown to be excellent tracers for the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> (DM) virial mass, even when distinct formation mechanisms are employed for blue and red GCs. Furthermore, the amount of DM smooth accretion is encoded in the GC abundances, therefore providing a measure for an otherwise nearly untraceable component of the formation history of galaxies.\n",
      "16        We analytically solve the problem of Bose star growth in the bath of gravitationally interacting particles. We find that after nucleation of this object, the bath is described by a self-similar solution of the kinetic equation, which is an attractor. Together with the conservation laws, this fixes mass evolution of the Bose star. Our results explain slowdown of the star growth at a certain &#34;core-halo&#34; mass, but also predict formation of the heavier and lighter objects in magistral <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> models.\n",
      "17        <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">Dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> subhaloes are key for the predictions of simulations of structure formation, but their existence frequently ends prematurely due to two technical issues, namely numerical disruption in N-body simulations and halo finders failing to identify them. Here we focus on the second issue, using the phase-space friends-of-friends halo finder ROCKSTAR as a benchmark (though we expect our results to translate to comparable codes). We confirm that the most prominent cause for losing track of subhaloes is tidal distortion rather than a low number of particles. As a solution, we present a flexible post-processing algorithm that tracks all subhalo particles over time, computes subhalo positions and masses based on those particles, and progressively removes stripped <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>. If a subhalo is lost by the halo finder, this algorithm keeps tracking its so-called ghost until it has almost no particles left or has truly merged with its host. We apply this technique to a large suite of N-body simulations and restore lost subhaloes to the halo catalogues, which has a dramatic effect on key summary statistics of large-scale structure. Specifically, the subhalo mass function increases by about 50% and the halo correlation function increases by a factor of two at small scales. While these quantitative results are somewhat specific to our algorithm, they demonstrate that particle tracking is a promising way to reliably follow haloes and reduce the need for orphan models. Our algorithm and augmented halo catalogues are publicly available.\n",
      "18        Ultralight bosons are predicted in many extensions to the Standard Model and are popular <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> candidates. The black hole superradiance mechanism allows for these particles to be probed using only their gravitational interaction. In this scenario, an ultralight boson cloud may form spontaneously around a spinning black hole and extract a non-negligible fraction of the black hole&#39;s mass. These oscillating clouds produce quasi-monochromatic, long-duration gravitational waves that may be detectable by ground-based or space-based gravitational wave detectors. We discuss the capability of a new long-duration signal tracking method, based on a hidden Markov model, to detect gravitational wave signals generated by ultralight vector boson clouds, including cases where the signal frequency evolution timescale is much shorter than that of a typical continuous wave signal. We quantify the detection horizon distances for vector boson clouds with current- and next-generation ground-based detectors. We demonstrate that vector clouds hosted by black holes with mass $\\gtrsim 60 M_{\\odot}$ and spin $\\gtrsim 0.6$ are within the reach of current-generation detectors up to a luminosity distance of $\\sim 1$ Gpc. This search method enables one to target vector boson clouds around remnant black holes from compact binary mergers detected by gravitational-wave detectors. We discuss the impact of the sky localization of the merger events and demonstrate that a typical remnant black hole reasonably well-localized by the current generation detector network is accessible in a follow-up search.\n",
      "19        Lithium-drifted silicon [Si(Li)] has been used for decades as an ionizing radiation detector in nuclear, particle, and astrophysical experiments, though such detectors have frequently been limited to small sizes (few cm$^2$) and cryogenic operating temperatures. The 10-cm-diameter Si(Li) detectors developed for the General Antiparticle Spectrometer (GAPS) balloon-borne <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> experiment are novel particularly for their requirements of low cost, large sensitive area (~10 m$^2$ for the full 1440-detector array), high temperatures (near -40$\\,^\\circ$C), and energy resolution below 4 keV FWHM for 20--100-keV x-rays. Previous works have discussed the manufacturing, passivation, and small-scale testing of prototype GAPS Si(Li) detectors. Here we show for the first time the results from detailed characterization of over 1100 flight detectors, illustrating the consistent intrinsic low-noise performance of a large sample of GAPS detectors. This work demonstrates the feasibility of large-area and low-cost Si(Li) detector arrays for next-generation astrophysics and nuclear physics applications.\n",

The boosted <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">Dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">Matter</span> flux at the edge of the Earth&#39;s atmosphere is expected to be pointing to the Galactic Center, with a flux 15 to 20 times larger than in the transverse direction.\n",
      "21        We investigate the reach of future gravitational wave (GW) detectors in probing inflaton couplings with visible sector particles that can either be bosonic or fermionic in nature. Assuming reheating takes place through perturbative quantum production from vacuum in presence of classical inflaton background field, we find that the spectral energy density of the primordial GW generated during inflation becomes sensitive to inflaton-<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> coupling. We conclude, obeying bounds from Big Bang Nucleosysthesis and Cosmic Microwave Background, that, e.g., inflaton-scalar couplings of the order of $\\sim\\mathcal{O}(10^{-20})$ GeV fall within the sensitivity range of several proposed GW detector facilities. However, this prediction is sensitive to the size of the inflationary scale, nature of the inflaton-<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> interaction and shape of the potential during reheating. Having found the time-dependent effective inflaton decay width, we also discuss its implications for <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> (DM) production from the thermal plasma via UV freeze-in during reheating. It is shown, that one can reproduce the observed DM abundance for its mass up to several PeVs, depending on the dimension of the operator connecting DM with the thermal bath and the associated scale of the UV physics. Thus we promote primordial GW to observables sensitive to feebly coupled inflaton, which is very challenging if not impossible to test in conventional particle physics laboratories or astrophysical measurements.\n",
      "22        We argue that demanding a consistent cosmological history, including the absence of domain walls and strongly interacting relics at the Peccei-Quinn scale, singles out two concrete realizations of hadronic QCD axions as viable <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> models. These realizations generally feature flavor-violating axion couplings to Standard Model quarks that are unsuppressed at low energies. As a consequence, experiments looking for flavor-violating hadronic processes involving the axion can be sensitive probes of QCD axion <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> models. In particular, we show that the NA62 and KOTO experiments could detect the $K\\rightarrowπ+ a$ decay for axions consistent with the observed <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> abundance via the post-inflationary misalignment mechanism.\n",
      "23        The mean <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> density within the turnaround radius, which is the boundary that separates a nonexpanding structure from the Hubble flow, was recently proposed as a novel cosmological probe. According to the spherical collapse model, the evolution with cosmic time of this turnaround density, $\\rm ρ_{ta}(z)$, can be used to determine both $\\rm Ω_m$ and $Ω_Λ$, independently of any other currently used probe. The properties of $\\rm ρ_{ta}$ predicted by the spherical collapse model were also shown to persist in the presence of full three-dimensional effects in $\\rm Λ$CDM N-body cosmological simulations when considering galaxy clusters at the present time, $z=0$. However, a small offset was discovered between the spherical-collapse prediction of the value of $ρ_{ta}$ at $z=0$ and its value measured in simulations. In this letter, we explore whether this offset evolves with cosmic time; whether it differs in different cosmologies; whether its origin can be confidently identified; and whether it can be corrected. We found that the offset does evolve slightly with redshift, and that it correlates strongly with the deviation from spherical symmetry of the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halo distribution inside and outside of the turnaround radius. We used an appropriate metric to quantify deviations in the environment of a structure from spherical symmetry. We found that using this metric, we can construct a sphericity-selected sample of halos for which the offset of $ρ_{ta}$ from the spherical collapse prediction is zero, independently of redshift and cosmology. We found that a sphericity-selected halo sample allows us to recover the simulated cosmology, and we conclude that the turnaround density evolution indeed encodes the cosmology in N-body simulations.\n",
      "24        We present a new suite of over 1,500 cosmological N-body simulations with varied Warm <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">Dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">Matter</span> (WDM) models ranging from 2.5 to 30 keV. We use these simulations to train Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to infer WDM particle masses from images of DM field data. Our fiducial setup can make accurate predictions of the WDM particle mass up to 7.5 keV at a 95% confidence level from small maps that cover an area of (25 h$^{-1}$ Mpc)$^2$. We vary the image resolution, simulation resolution, redshift, and cosmology of our fiducial setup to better understand how our model is making predictions. Using these variations, we find that our models are most dependent on simulation resolution, minimally dependent on image resolution, not systematically dependent on redshift, and robust to varied cosmologies. We also find that an important feature to distinguish between WDM models is present with a linear size between 100 and 200 h$^{-1}$ kpc. We compare our fiducial model to one trained on the power spectrum alone and find that our field-level model can make 2x more precise predictions and can make accurate predictions to 2x as massive WDM particle masses when used on the same data. Overall, we find that the field-level data can be used to accurately differentiate between WDM models and contain more information than is captured by the power spectrum. This technique can be extended to more complex DM models and opens up new opportunities to explore alternative DM models in a cosmological environment.\n",
      "25        The properties of globular clusters (GCs) contain valuable information of their host galaxies and <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span>-<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halos. In the remarkable example of ultra-diffuse galaxy, NGC5846-UDG1, the GC population exhibits strong radial mass segregation, indicative of dynamical-friction-driven orbital decay, which opens the possibility of using imaging data alone to constrain the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span>-<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> content of the galaxy. To explore this possibility, we develop a semi-analytical model of GC evolution, which starts from the initial mass function, the initial structure-mass relation, and the initial spatial distribution of the GC progenitors, and follows the effects of dynamical friction, tidal evolution, and two-body relaxation. Using Markov Chain Monte Carlo, we forward-model the GCs in a NGC5846-UDG1-like potential to match the observed GC mass, size, and spatial distributions, and to constrain the profile of the host halo and the origin of the GCs. We find that, with the assumptions of zero mass segregation when the star clusters were born, NGC5846-UDG1 is <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span>-<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> poor compared to what is expected from stellar-to-halo-mass relations, and its halo concentration is low, irrespective of having a cuspy or a cored halo profile. Its GC population has an initial spatial distribution more extended than the smooth stellar distribution. We discuss the results in the context of scaling laws of galaxy-halo connections, and warn against naively using the GC-abundance-halo-mass relation to infer the halo mass of UDGs. Our model is generally applicable to GC-rich dwarf galaxies, and is publicly available at https://github.com/JiangFangzhou/GCevo.\n",
      "26        The Epoch of Reionization (EoR) neutral Hydrogen (HI) 21-cm signal evolves significantly along the line-of-sight (LoS) due to the light-cone (LC) effect. It is important to accurately incorporate this in simulations in order to correctly interpret the signal. 21-cm LC simulations are typically produced by stitching together slices from a finite number $(N_{\\rm RS})$ of &#39;&#39;reionization snapshot&#39;&#39;, each corresponding to a different stage of reionization. In this paper, we have quantified the errors in the 21-cm LC simulation due to the finite value of $N_{\\rm RS}$. We show that this can introduce large discontinuities $(&gt; 200 \\%)$ at the stitching boundaries when $N_{\\rm RS}$ is small $(= 2,4)$ and the mean neutral fraction jumps by $δ\\bar{x}_{\\rm HI} = 0.2,0.1$ respectively at the stitching boundaries. This drops to $17 \\%$ for $N_{\\rm RS} = 13$ where $δ\\bar{x}_{\\rm HI}=0.02$. We present and also validate a method for mitigating this error by increasing $N_{\\rm RS}$ without a proportional increase in the computational costs which are mainly incurred in generating the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> and halo density fields. Our method generates these fields only at a few redshifts, and interpolates them to generate reionization snapshots at closely spaced redshifts. We use this to generate 21-cm LC simulations with $N_{\\rm RS} = 26,51,101$ and $201$, and show that the errors go down as $N_{\\rm RS}^{-1}$.\n",
      "27        The advent of gravitational wave astronomy has seen a huge influx of new predictions for potential discoveries of beyond the Standard Model fields. The coupling of all fundamental fields to gravity, together with its dominance on large scales, makes gravitational physics a rich laboratory to study fundamental physics. This holds especially true for the search for the elusive <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> photon, a promising <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> candidate. The <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> photon is predicted to generate instabilities in a rotating black hole spacetime, birthing a macroscopic Bose-Einstein condensate. These condensates can especially form around super massive black holes, modifying the dynamical inspiralling process. This then opens another window to leverage future space-borne gravitational wave antennas to join the hunt for the elusive <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> particle. This study builds a preliminary model for the gravitational waveform emitted by such a dressed extreme mass-ratio inspiral. Comparing these waveforms to the vacuum scenario allows projections to the potential constrainability on the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> photon mass by space-borne gravitational wave antennas. The superradiant instability of a massive vector field on a Kerr background is calculated and the modification to the dynamics of an inspiralling solar mass-scale compact object is determined with approximations on the backreaction effect of the cloud on the compact object. The end result is the projection that the LISA mission should be able to constrain the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> photon mass using extreme mass ratio inspirals in the range $[1.8 \\times 10^{-17}, 4.47 \\times 10^{-16}]$ eV.\n",
      "28        Recent observations made by the JWST have revealed a number of massive galaxies at high redshift ($z$). The presence of these galaxies appears at odds with the current $Λ$CDM cosmology. Here we investigate the possibility of alleviating the tension by incorporating uncertainties from three sources in counting massive galaxies at high $z$: cosmic variance, error in stellar mass estimate, and contribution by backsplash. We find that each of the sources can significantly increase the cumulative stellar mass density $ρ_*(&gt;M_*)$ at the high-mass end, and the combination of them can boost the density by more than one order of magnitude. Assuming a star formation efficiency of $ε_* \\sim 0.5$, cosmic variance alone can reduce the tension to $2σ$ level, except the most massive galaxy at $z=8$. Including in addition a lognormal dispersion with a width of 0.3 dex in the stellar mass can bring the observed stellar mass density at $z \\sim 7 - 10$ to the $2σ$ range of the cosmic variance. The tension is completely eliminated when gas stripped from backsplash halos is also taken into account. Our results highlight the importance of fully modeling uncertainties when interpreting observational data of rare objects. We use the constrained simulation, ELUCID, to investigate the descendants of high $z$ massive galaxies. We find that a significant portion of these galaxies end up in massive halos with mass $M_{\\rm halo} &gt; 10^{13} h^{-1}M_\\odot $ at $z=0$. A large fraction of central galaxies in $M_{\\rm halo} \\geqslant 10^{14.5} h^{-1}M_\\odot$ halos today are predicted to contain significant amounts of ancient stars formed in massive galaxies at $z\\sim 8$. This prediction can be tested by studying the structure and stellar population of central galaxies in present-day massive clusters.\n",
      "29        Within the $Λ$CDM cosmology, <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> haloes are comprised of both a smooth component and a population of smaller, gravitationally bound subhaloes. These components are often treated as a single halo when halo properties, such as density profiles, are extracted from simulations. Recent work has shown that density profiles change substantially when subhalo mass is excluded. In this paper, we expand on this result by analysing the change in three specific host halo properties -- concentration ($c_{\\rm{NFW}}$), spin ($λ_{\\rm Bullock}$), and shape ($c/a$), -- when calculated only from the smooth component of the halo. This analysis is performed on both Milky Way-mass haloes and cluster-mass haloes in high-resolution, zoom-in, $N$-body simulations. We find that when subhaloes are excluded the median value of (1) $c_{\\rm{NFW}}$ is enhanced by $\\approx 38 \\pm 12\\%$ and $\\approx 88 \\pm 7.7\\%$ for Milky Way mass ($10^{12.1}\\,\\text{M}_\\odot$) and cluster mass ($10^{14.8}\\,\\text{M}_\\odot$) haloes respectively, (2) $λ_{\\rm Bullock}$ is reduced for Milky Way mass by $\\approx 16 \\pm 6.8\\%$ and cluster mass haloes by $\\approx 32 \\pm 8.9\\%$. Additionally, with the removal of subhaloes, cluster mass haloes tend to become more spherical as the ratio of minor-to-major axis, $c/a$, increases by $\\approx 12 \\pm 4\\%$, whereas Milky Way mass haloes remain approximately the same shape with $c/a$ changed by $\\approx 1.2 \\pm 5.6\\%$. The fractional change of each of these properties depends primarily on the amount of mass that is removed from the halo system and, to a lesser extent, mass accretion history. Our findings demonstrate that the properties of the smooth components of <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> haloes are biased relative to the total mass of the halo including subhaloes.\n",
      "30        In order to test active galactic nucleus (AGN) unification and evolutionary models, we measured the AGN clustering properties as a function of AGN obscuration defined in terms of hydrogen column density, $N_{\\rm H}$. In addition to measuring the clustering of unobscured ($N_{\\rm H} &lt; 10^{22}\\,{\\rm cm}^{-2}$) and moderately obscured ($10^{22} \\leq N_{\\rm H} &lt; 10^{23.5}$) AGNs, we also targeted highly obscured sources ($N_{\\rm H}\\geq 10^{23.5}$) up to redshifts of $z=3$. We have compiled one of the largest samples of X-ray-selected AGNs from a total of eight deep XMM/Chandra surveys. We measured the clustering as a function of both AGN obscuration and redshift using the projected two-point correlation function, $w_{\\rm p}(r_{\\rm p})$. We modeled the large-scale clustering signal, measured the AGN bias, $b(z, N_{\\rm H})$, and interpreted it in terms of the typical AGN host <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halo, $M_{\\rm halo}(z, N_{\\rm H}$). We find no significant dependence of AGN clustering on obscuration, suggesting similar typical masses of the hosting halos as a function of $N_{\\rm H}$. This result matches expectations of AGN unification models, in which AGN obscuration depends mainly on the viewing angle of the obscuring torus. We measured, for the first time, the clustering of highly obscured AGNs and find that these objects reside in halos with typical mass $\\log M_{\\rm halo} = 12.98_{-0.22}^{+0.17} [h^{-1} M_\\odot]$ ($12.28_{-0.19}^{+0.13}$) at low $z \\sim 0.7$ (high $z \\sim 1.8$) redshifts. We find that irrespective of obscuration, an increase in AGN bias with redshift is slower than the expectation for a constant halo mass and instead follows the growth rate of halos, known as the passive evolution track. This implies that for those AGNs the clustering is mainly driven by the mass growth rate of the hosting halos and galaxies across cosmic time.\n",
      "31        Mergers between galaxy clusters are an important stage in the formation of the large-scale structure of the Universe. Some of the mergers show a spectacular bow shock that formed as a result of recent passage of a smaller cluster through a bigger one, the classic example of this being the so-called bullet cluster. In this paper, I describe ten examples of interacting clusters identified among 200 of the most massive objects, with total masses above $1.4 \\times 10^{14}$ M$_{\\odot}$, from the IllustrisTNG300 simulation by searching for prominent bow shocks in their temperature maps. Despite different mass ratios of the two merging clusters, the events are remarkably similar in many respects. In all cases, the companion cluster passed close to the main one only once, between 0.9 and 0.3 Gyr ago, with the pericenter distance of 100-530 kpc and a velocity of up to 3400 km s$^{-1}$. The subcluster, typically an order of magnitude smaller in mass than the main cluster before the interaction, loses most of its <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> and gas in the process. The displacement between the collisionless part of the remnant and the bow shock is such that the remnant typically lags behind the shock or coincides with it, with a single exception of the merger occurring with the largest velocity. Usually about 1% of the gas cells in the merging clusters are shocked, and the median Mach numbers of these gas cells are around two. Due to the relatively small size of the simulation box, no close analog of the bullet cluster was found, but I identified one case that is similar in terms of mass, velocity, and displacement. The presented cases bear more resemblance to less extreme observed interacting clusters such as A520 and Coma.\n",
      "32        Microscopic horizonless relics could form in the early universe either directly through gravitational collapse or as stable remnants of the Hawking evaporation of primordial black holes. In both cases they completely or partially evade cosmological constraints arising from Hawking evaporation and in certain mass ranges can explain the entirety of the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>. We systematically explore the stochastic gravitational-wave background associated with the formation of microscopic <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span>-<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> relics in various scenarios, adopting an agnostic approach and discussing the limitations introduced by existing constraints, possible ways to circumvent the latter, and expected astrophysical foregrounds. Interestingly, this signal is at most marginally detectable with current interferometers but could be detectable by third-generations instruments such as the Einstein Telescope, strengthening their potential as discovery machines.\n",
      "33        In direct <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> (DM) detection via scattering off the electrons, the momentum transfer plays a crucial role. Previous work showed that for self-interacting DM, if the DM particle has a size (the so-called puffy DM), the radius effect could dominate the momentum transfer and become another source of velocity dependence for self-scattering cross section. In this work we investigate the direct detection of puffy DM particles with different radii through electron recoil. We find that comparing with the available experimental exclusion limits dominated by the mediator effect for XENON10, XENON100 and XENON1T, the constraints on the puffy DM-electron scattering cross-section become much weaker for large radius DM particles. For small-radius DM particles, the constraints remain similar to the point-like DM case.\n",
      "34        Boson stars are gravitationally bound objects that arise in ultralight <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> models and form in the centers of galactic halos or axion miniclusters. We systematically study the excitations of a boson star, taking into account the mixing between positive and negative frequencies introduced by gravity. We show that the spectrum contains zero-energy modes in the monopole and dipole sectors resulting from spontaneous symmetry breaking by the boson star background. We analyze the general properties of the eigenmodes and derive their orthogonality and completeness conditions which have non-standard form due to the positive-negative frequency mixing. The eigenvalue problem is solved numerically for the first few energy levels in different multipole sectors and the results are compared to the solutions of the Schrödinger equation in fixed boson star gravitational potential. The two solutions differ significantly for the lowest modes, but get close for higher levels. We further confirm the normal mode spectrum in 3D wave simulations where we inject perturbations with different multipoles. As an application of the normal mode solutions, we compute the matrix element entering the evaporation rate of a boson star immersed in a hot axion gas. The computation combines the use of exact wavefunctions for the low-lying bound states and of the Schrödinger approximation for the high-energy excitations.\n",
      "35        If long-range attractive forces exist and are stronger than gravity then cosmic halo formation can begin in the radiation-dominated era. We study a simple realization of this effect in a system where <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> fermions have Yukawa interactions mediated by scalar particles, analogous to the Higgs boson in the standard model. We develop a self-consistent description of the system including exact background dynamics of the scalar field, and precise modelling of the fermion density fluctuations. For the latter, we provide accurate approximations for the linear growth as well as quantitative modelling of the nonlinear evolution using N-body simulations. We find that halo formation occurs exponentially fast and on scales substantially larger than simple estimates predict. The final fate of these halos remains uncertain, but could be annihilation, <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> stars, primordial black holes, or even the existence of galaxy-sized halos at <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>-radiation equality. More generally, our results demonstrate the importance of mapping scalar-mediated interactions onto structure formation outcomes and constraints for beyond the standard model theories.\n",
      "36        Recent analysis on the stellar kinematics of ultra-faint dwarf (UFD) galaxies has put a stringent upper limit on the self-scattering cross section of <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>, i.e., $σ/m&lt;{\\cal O}(0.1)\\,{\\rm cm^2/g}$ at the scattering velocity of ${\\cal O}(10)\\,{\\rm km/s}$. Resonant self-interacting <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> (rSIDM) is one possibility that can be consistent with the UFDs and explain the low central densities of rotation-supported galaxies; the cross section is resonantly enhanced to be $σ/m = {\\cal O}(1)\\,{\\rm cm^2/g}$ around the scattering velocity of ${\\cal O}(100)\\,{\\rm km/s}$ while being suppressed at lower velocities. To further assess this possibility, since the inferred <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> distribution of halos from astrophysical observations is usually compared to that in constant-cross section SIDM (cSIDM), whether the structures of rSIDM halos can be approximated by the cSIDM halo profiles needs to be clarified. In this work, we employ the grovothermal fluid method to investigate the structural evolution of rSIDM halos in a wide mass range. We find that except for halos in a specific mass range, the present structures of rSIDM halos are virtually indistinguishable from those of the cSIDM halos. For halos in the specific mass range, the resonant self-scattering renders a break in their density profile. We demonstrate how such a density-profile break appears in astrophysical observations, e.g., rotation curves and line-of-sight velocity dispersion profiles. We show that for halos above the specific mass range, the density-profile break thermalizes to disappear before the present. We demonstrate that such distinctive thermalization dynamics can leave imprints on the orbital classes of stars with similar ages and metallicities.\n",
      "37        The E-type $α$-attractor models of single-field inflation were generalized further in order to accommodate production of primordial black holes (PBH) via adding a near-inflection point to the inflaton scalar potential at smaller scales, in good agreement with measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation. A minimal number of new parameters was used but their fine-tuning was maximized in order to increase possible masses of PBH formed during an ultra-slow-roll phase leading to a large enhancement of the power spectrum of scalar (curvature) perturbations by 6 or 7 orders of magnitude against the power spectrum of perturbations observed in CMB. It was found that extreme fine-tuning of the parameters in our models can lead to a formation of the Earth-size PBH with the masses of approximately $10^{27}$ g, still in agreement with CMB observations. Quantum corrections are known to lead to the perturbative upper bound on the amplitude of large scalar perturbations responsible for PBH production. The quantum (one-loop) corrections in our models were found to be suppressed by one order of magnitude for PBH with the masses of approximately $10^{19}$ g, which may form the whole <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> in the Universe.\n",
      "38        We discuss in detail the possibility that the &#34;type-II majoron&#34; -- that is, the pseudo Nambu-Goldstone boson that arises in the context of the type-II seesaw mechanism if the lepton number is spontaneously broken by an additional singlet scalar -- account for the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> (DM) observed in the universe. We study the requirements the model&#39;s parameters have to fulfill in order to reproduce the measured DM relic abundance through two possible production mechanisms in the early universe, freeze-in and misalignment, both during a standard radiation-dominated era and early <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> domination. We then study possible signals of type-II majoron DM and the present and expected constraints on the parameter space that can be obtained from cosmological observations, direct detection experiments, and present and future searches for decaying DM at neutrino telescopes and cosmic-ray experiments. We find that -- depending on the majoron mass, the production mechanism, and the value of the vacuum expectation value of the type-II triplet -- all of the three decay modes (photons, electrons, neutrinos) of majoron DM particles can yield observable signals at future indirect searches for DM. Furthermore, in a corner of the parameter space, detection of majoron DM is possible through electron recoil at running and future direct detection experiments.\n",
      "39        Running vacuum models and viscous <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> scenarios beyond perfect fluid idealization are two appealing theoretical strategies that have been separately studied as alternatives to solve some problems rooted in the $Λ$CDM cosmological model. In this paper, we combine these two notions in a single cosmological setting and investigate their cosmological implications, paying particular attention in the interplay between these two constituents in different cosmological periods. Specifically, we consider a well-studied running vacuum model inspired by renormalization group, and a recently proposed general parameterization for the bulk viscosity $ξ$. By employing dynamical system analysis, we explore the physical aspects of the new phase space that emerges from the combined models and derive stability conditions that ensure complete cosmological dynamics. We identify four distinct classes of models and find that the critical points of the phase space are non-trivially renewed compared to the single scenarios. We then proceed, in a joint and complementary way to the dynamical system analysis, with a detailed numerical exploration to quantify the impact of both the running parameter and the bulk viscosity coefficient on the cosmological evolution. Thus, for some values of the model parameters, numerical solutions show qualitative differences from the $Λ$CDM model, which is phenomenologically appealing in light of cosmological observations.\n",
      "40        The intrinsic alignment (IA) of observed galaxy shapes with the underlying cosmic web is a source of contamination in weak lensing surveys. Sensitive methods to identify the IA signal will therefore need to be included in the upcoming weak lensing analysis pipelines. Hydrodynamical cosmological simulations allow us to directly measure the intrinsic ellipticities of galaxies and thus provide a powerful approach to predict and understand the IA signal. Here we employ the novel, large-volume hydrodynamical simulation MTNG740, a product of the MillenniumTNG (MTNG) project, to study the IA of galaxies. We measure the projected correlation functions between the intrinsic shape/shear of galaxies and various tracers of large-scale structure, $w_{+g},\\ w_{+m},\\ w_{++}$ over the radial range $r_{\\rm p} \\in [0.02 , 200]\\,h^{-1}{\\rm Mpc}$ and at redshifts $z=0.0$, $0.5$ and $1.0$. We detect significant signal-to-noise IA signals with the density field for both elliptical and spiral galaxies. We also find significant intrinsic shear-shear correlations for ellipticals. We further examine correlations of the intrinsic shape of galaxies with the local tidal field. Here we find a significant IA signal for elliptical galaxies assuming a linear model. We also detect a weak IA signal for spiral galaxies under a quadratic tidal torquing model. Lastly, we measure the alignment between central galaxies and their host <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span>-<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halos, finding small to moderate misalignments between their principal axes that decline with halo mass.\n",
      "41        We study weak gravitational lensing convergence maps produced from the MillenniumTNG (MTNG) simulations by direct projection of the mass distribution on the past backwards lightcone of a fiducial observer. We explore the lensing maps over a large dynamic range in simulation mass and angular resolution, allowing us to establish a clear assessment of numerical convergence. By comparing full physics hydrodynamical simulations with corresponding <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span>-<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>-only runs we quantify the impact of baryonic physics on the most important weak lensing statistics. Likewise, we predict the impact of massive neutrinos reliably far into the non-linear regime. We also demonstrate that the &#34;fixed &amp; paired&#34; variance suppression technique increases the statistical robustness of the simulation predictions on large scales not only for time slices but also for continuously output lightcone data. We find that both baryonic and neutrino effects substantially impact weak lensing shear measurements, with the latter dominating over the former on large angular scales. Thus, both effects must explicitly be included to obtain sufficiently accurate predictions for stage IV lensing surveys. Reassuringly, our results agree accurately with other simulation results where available, supporting the promise of simulation modelling for precision cosmology far into the non-linear regime.\n",
      "42        An era of kination occurs when the Universe&#39;s energy density is dominated by a fast-rolling scalar field. <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">Dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> that is thermally produced during an era of kination requires larger-than-canonical annihilation cross sections to generate the observed <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> relic abundance. Furthermore, <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> density perturbations that enter the horizon during an era of kination grow linearly with the scale factor prior to radiation domination. We show how the resulting enhancement to the small-scale <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> power spectrum increases the microhalo abundance and boosts the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> annihilation rate. We then use gamma-ray observations to constrain thermal <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> production during kination. The annihilation boost factor depends on the minimum halo mass, which is determined by the small-scale cutoff in the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> power spectrum. Therefore, observational limits on the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> annihilation rate imply a minimum cutoff scale for a given <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> particle mass and kination scenario. For <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> that was once in thermal equilibrium with the Standard Model, this constraint establishes a maximum allowed kinetic decoupling temperature for the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>. This bound on the decoupling temperature implies that the growth of perturbations during kination cannot appreciably boost the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> annihilation rate if <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> was once in thermal equilibrium with the Standard Model.\n",
      "43        We present the measurement of total and stellar/<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> decomposed mass density profile around a sample of galaxy groups and clusters with dynamical masses derived from integral-field stellar kinematics from the MaNGA survey in Paper~I and weak lensing derived from the DECaLS imaging survey. Combining the two data sets enables accurate measurement of the radial density distribution from several kpc to Mpc scales. Intriguingly, we find that the excess surface density derived from stellar kinematics in the inner region cannot be explained by simply adding an NFW <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halo extrapolated from lensing measurement at a larger scale to a stellar mass component derived from the NASA-Sloan Atlas (NSA) catalog. We find that a good fit to both data sets requires a stellar mass normalization about 3 times higher than that derived from the NSA catalog, which would require an unrealistically too-heavy initial mass function for stellar mass estimation. If we keep the stellar mass normalization to that of the NSA catalog but allow a varying inner <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> density profile, we obtain an asymptotic slope of $γ_{\\rm gnfw}$= $1.82_{-0.25}^{+0.15}$, $γ_{\\rm gnfw}$= $1.48_{-0.41}^{+0.20}$ for the group bin and the cluster bin respectively, significantly steeper than the NFW case. We also compare the total mass inner density slopes with those from Illustris-TNG300 and find that the values from the simulation are lower than the observation by at least $3σ$ level.\n",
      "44        We present dynamical scaling relations, combined with the stellar population properties, for a subsample of about 6000 nearby galaxies with the most reliable dynamical models extracted from the full MaNGA sample of 10K galaxies. We show that the inclination-corrected mass plane (MP) for both early-type galaxies (ETGs) and late-type galaxies (LTGs), which links dynamical mass, projected half-light radius $R_{\\rm e}$, and the second stellar velocity moment $σ_{\\rm e}$ within $R_{\\rm e}$, satisfies the virial theorem and is even tighter than the uncorrected one. We find a clear parabolic relation between $\\lg(M/L)(&lt;R_{\\rm e})$, the total mass-to-light ratio within a sphere of radius $R_{\\rm e}$, and $\\lgσ_{\\rm e}$, with the $M/L$ increasing with $σ_{\\rm e}$ and for older stellar populations. However, the relation for ETGs is linear and the one for the youngest galaxies is constant. We confirm and improve the relation between average logarithmic total density slopes $γ_{_{\\rm T}}$ and $σ_{\\rm e}$: $γ_{_{\\rm T}}$ become steeper with increasing $σ_{\\rm e}$ until $\\lg(σ_{\\rm e}/{\\rm km\\,s^{-1}})\\approx 2.2$ and then remain constant around $γ_{_{\\rm T}}\\approx -2.2$. The $γ_{_{\\rm T}}-σ_{\\rm e}$ variation is larger for LTGs than ETGs. At fixed $σ_{\\rm e}$ the total density profiles steepen with galaxy age and for ETGs. We find generally low <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> fractions, median $f_{\\rm DM}(&lt;R_{\\rm e})=8$ per cent, within a sphere of radius $R_{\\rm e}$.

      "45        We analyze the global stellar population, radial gradients and non-parametric star formation history of $\\sim 10$K galaxies from the MaNGA Survey final data release 17 (DR17), based on stellar population synthesis and full-spectrum fitting, and relate them with dynamical properties of galaxies. We confirm that stellar population correlates with stellar velocity dispersion $σ_{\\rm e}$ better than with stellar mass $M_{\\ast}$, but also find that younger galaxies are more metal-poor at fixed $σ_{\\rm e}$. Stellar age, metallicity, and mass-to-light ratio $M_{\\ast}/L$ all decrease with galaxy rotation, while radial gradients become more negative (i.e., younger, more metal-poor, and lower $M_{\\ast}/L$ in the outskirts). The trend between metallicity gradients and rotation reverses for slow rotators, which stand out for their more negative metallicity gradients than faster-rotating galaxies. We highlight a population of massive disk galaxies on the green valley, on the $(σ_{\\rm e},\\rm Age)$ plane, that show steep negative age and metallicity gradients, consistent with their old central bulges surrounded by young star-forming disks and metal-poor gas accretion. Galaxies with high $σ_{\\rm e}$, steep total mass-density slope, low <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> fraction, high $M_{\\ast}/L$, and high metallicity have the highest star-formation rate at earlier times, and are currently quenched.

      "46        This is the first paper in our series on the combined analysis of the Dynamics and stellar Population (DynPop) for the MaNGA survey in the final SDSS Data Release 17 (DR17). Here we present a catalogue of dynamically-determined quantities for over 10000 nearby galaxies based on integral-field stellar kinematics from the MaNGA survey. The dynamical properties are extracted using the axisymmetric Jeans Anisotropic Modelling (JAM) method, which was previously shown to be the most accurate for this kind of study. We assess systematic uncertainties using eight dynamical models with different assumptions. We use two orientations of the velocity ellipsoid: either cylindrically-aligned JAM$_{\\rm cyl}$ or spherically-aligned JAM$_{\\rm sph}$. We also make four assumptions for the models&#39; <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> vs. luminous <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> distributions: (1) mass-follows-light, (2) free NFW <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> halo, (3) cosmologically-constrained NFW halo, (4) generalized NFW <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> halo, i.e. with free inner slope. In this catalogue, we provide the quantities related to the mass distributions (e.g. the density slopes and enclosed mass within a sphere of a given radius for total mass, stellar mass, and <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> mass components). We also provide the complete models which can be used to compute the full luminous and mass distribution of each galaxy. Additionally, we visually assess the qualities of the models to help with model selections. We estimate the observed scatter in the measured quantities which decreases as expected with improvements in quality. For the best data quality, we find a remarkable consistency of measured quantities between different models, highlighting the robustness of the results.\n",
      "47        What is the highest energy at which gravitons can be observed? We address this question by studying graviton-to-photon conversion - the inverse-Gertsenshtein effect - in the magnetic field of the Milky Way. We find that above $\\sim 1~\\mbox{PeV}$ the effective photon mass grows large enough to quench the conversion rate. The induced photon flux is comparable to the sensitivity of LHAASO to a diffuse $γ$-ray background, but only for graviton abundances of order $Ω_{\\text{gw}} h^2_0 \\sim 1$. In the future, owing to a better understanding of $γ$-ray backgrounds, larger effective areas and longer observation times, sub-PeV shimmering gravitons with a realistic abundance of $Ω_{\\text{gw}} h^2_0 \\sim 0.01$ could be detected. We show that this is achieved in a cosmologically-motivated scenario of post-recombination superheavy <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> decay. Therefore, the sub-PeV range might be the ultimate energy frontier at which gravitons can be observed.\n",

However, the high-mass end of this relation is not well determined from previous data and shows large scatter. We analyze the globular cluster systems (GCSs) of a homogeneous sample of 11 brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) through DOLPHOT photometry of their deep Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images in the F814W filter. We standardize the definition of $M_{GCS}$, the total GCS mass, by using the GC total population within a limiting radius of $0.1 R_{virial}$, while the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span>-<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halo mass $M_h$ is determined from the weak-lensing calibration of $M_h$ versus $M_{bary}$. When these 11 BCGs are added to the previously studied homogeneous catalogue of Virgo member galaxies, a total value for $η= M_{GCS}/M_h$ is found to be $(3.0\\pm1.8_{internal})\\times10^{-5}$, slightly higher than previous estimates but with much reduced uncertainty. Perhaps more importantly, the results suggest that the relation continues to have a near-linear shape at the highest galaxy masses, strongly reinforcing the conclusion that accreted GCs make a major contribution to the GC populations at high galaxy mass.\n",
      "49        We introduce an analytic surface density profile for <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halos that accurately reproduces the structure of simulated halos of mass $M_{\\rm vir} = 10^{7-11}\\ M_\\odot$, making it useful for modeling line-of-sight perturbers in strong gravitational lensing models. The two-parameter function has an analytic deflection potential and is more accurate than the projected Navarro, Frenk &amp; White (NFW) profile commonly adopted at this mass scale for perturbers, especially at the small radii of most relevant for lensing perturbations. Using a characteristic radius, $R_{-1}$, where the log slope of surface density is equal to $-1$, and an associated surface density, $Σ_{-1}$, we can represent the expected lensing signal from line-of-sight halos statistically, for an ensemble of halo orientations, using a distribution of {\\em projected concentration} parameters, $\\mathcal{C}_{\\rm vir} := r_{\\rm vir}/ R_{-1}$. Though an individual halo can have a projected concentration that varies with orientation with respect to the observer, the range of projected concentrations correlates with the usual three-dimensional halo concentration in a way that enables ease of use.\n",

We search for Lyman-break dropout-selected galaxies using HST WFC3/ACS broadband imaging in the fields of three $6 &lt; z &lt; 7$ quasars, as well as their simultaneously observed coordinated-parallel fields, and constrain their photometric redshifts using EAZY. One field, J0305-3150, shows a volume density 10$\\times$ higher than the blank-field UV luminosity function (UVLF) at M$_{UV} &lt; -20$, with tentative evidence of a 3$σ$ overdensity in its parallel field located 15 cMpc away. Another field, J2054-0005, shows an angular overdensity within 500 ckpc from the quasar but still consistent with UVLF predictions within 3$σ$, while the last field, J2348-3054, shows no enhancement. We discuss methods for reducing uncertainty in overdensity measurements when using photometric selection and show that we can robustly select LBGs consistent with being physically associated with the quasar, corroborated by existing JWST/NIRCam WFSS data in the J0305 field. Even accounting for incompleteness, the overdensities in J0305 and J2054 are higher for brighter galaxies at short angular separations, suggesting preferential enhancement of more massive galaxies in the immediate vicinity of the quasar. Finally, we compare the LBG population with previously-identified [CII] and mm-continuum companions; the LBG overdensities are not accompanied by an enhanced number of dusty galaxies, suggesting that the overdense quasar fields are not in the bursty star-forming phase sometimes seen in high-redshift protoclusters.\n"

      "2        This thesis explores the effects of <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> (DM) on neutron stars (NSs) using the relativistic mean-field (RMF) model. The effects of DM on NS properties, including the mass-radius relation, the moment of inertia, and tidal deformability, are calculated by varying its fraction. The study found that the EOS becomes softer with increasing DM momentum, and the DM has marginal effects on nuclear <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> properties, except for the EOSs and binding energy per particle. The study also calculated the properties of isolated, static, and rotating DM admixed NS and found that the DM has significant effects on both static and rotating NS. We have also observed that a tiny amount of DM can accumulate inside the NS, and more amount of it makes the NS unstable. The study also suggests that the secondary component might be a NS with DM content if the underlying nuclear EOS is sufficiently stiff. The $f$-mode oscillations of the DM admixed hyperon stars are calculated and found that there exist a correlation between canonical $f$-mode frequency and the dimensionless tidal deformability parameter ($Λ_{1.4}$) and we have put a constraint on $f$-mode frequency using GW170817 data. Finally, we have calculated the DM admixed binary NS properties and found that the binary system becomes less deformed and sustains more time in its inspiral phases with the addition of DM. Therefore, we suggest that one can take DM inside the compact objects while modeling the inspiral waveforms for the BNS systems.\n",
      "3        Radiative emissions from electrons and positrons generated by <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> (DM) annihilation or decay are one of the most investigated signals in indirect searches of WIMPs. Ideal targets must have large ratio of DM to baryonic <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>. However, such ``<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span>&#39;&#39; systems have a poorly known level of magnetic turbulence, which determines the residence time of the electrons and positrons and therefore also the strength of the expected signal. This typically leads to significant uncertainties in the derived DM bounds. In a novel approach, we compute the self-confinement of the DM-induced electrons and positrons. Indeed, they themselves generate irregularities in the magnetic field, thus setting a lower limit on the presence of the magnetic turbulence. We specifically apply this approach to dwarf spheroidal galaxies. Finally, by comparing the expected synchrotron emission with radio data from the direction of the Draco galaxy collected at the Giant Metre Radio Telescope, we show that the proposed approach can be used to set robust and competitive bounds on WIMP DM.\n",
      "4        The particle origin of <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> (DM) is still one of the main puzzles in modern physics. One of the most promising search strategy to detect DM at laboratories is through the indirect search of cosmic particles that are produced from DM annihilation in space. In particular, the flux of cosmic positrons has been measured with high precision by the AMS-02 experiment demonstrating that an excess above 10 GeV, with respect to the secondary production, is present. We study in this paper the possible DM origin of the positron excess finding the values of the DM mass $M$ and annihilation cross section $\\langle σv \\rangle$ that are needed to fit high-energy positron data. In particular, we find that for DM annihilating into $b\\bar{b}$ it is required to have $M=43$ TeV and $\\langle σv \\rangle = 10^{-21}$ cm$^3$/s while for $τ^+τ^-$ $M=2$ TeV and $\\langle σv \\rangle = 3\\times 10^{-23}$ cm$^3$/s. If DM produce positrons, they are expected to generate gamma rays from the center of the Milky Way and around dwarf galaxy satellites of the Galaxy. We thus combine the values for the DM mass and annihilation cross section obtained with the fit to AMS-02 positron data with the upper limits derived with the non-detection of $γ$ rays with HESS in the direction of the Galactic center and Fermi-LAT for the combined analysis of dwarf galaxies. The main result of the paper is that only DM annihilating into $μ^+ μ^-$ with a mass around 500 GeV and $\\langle σv \\rangle = 4\\times 10^{-24}$ cm$^3$/s can fit AMS-02 data and be compatible with the upper limits found with $γ$ rays. As for the $τ^+ τ^-$ ($b\\bar{b}$) channel, DM can contribute at most at a few tens $\\%$ (a few \\%) level.\n",
      "5        The elastic scattering between <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> (DM) and radiation can potentially explain small-scale observations that the cold <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> faces as a challenge, as damping density fluctuations via <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> acoustic oscillations in the early universe erases small-scale structure. We study a semi-analytical subhalo model for interacting <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> with radiation, based on the extended Press-Schechter formalism and subhalos&#39; tidal evolution prescription. We also test the elastic scattering between DM and neutrinos using observations of Milky-Way satellites from the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">Dark</span> Energy Survey and PanSTARRS1. We conservatively impose strong constraints on the DM-neutrino scattering cross section of $σ_{{\\rm DM}\\text{-}ν,n}\\propto E_ν^n$ $(n=0,2,4)$ at $95\\%$ confidence level (CL), $σ_{{\\rm DM}\\text{-}ν,0}&lt; 10^{-32}\\ {\\rm cm^2}\\ (m_{\\rm DM}/{\\rm GeV})$, $σ_{{\\rm DM}\\text{-}ν,2}&lt; 10^{-43}\\ {\\rm cm^2}\\ (m_{\\rm DM}/{\\rm GeV})(E_ν/E_ν^0)^2$ and $σ_{{\\rm DM}\\text{-}ν,4}&lt; 10^{-54}\\ {\\rm cm^2}\\ (m_{\\rm DM}/{\\rm GeV})(E_ν/E_ν^0)^4$, where $E_ν^0$ is the average momentum of relic cosmic neutrinos today, $E_ν^0 \\simeq 3.15 T_ν^0 \\simeq 6.1\\ {\\rm K}$. By imposing a satellite forming condition, we obtain the strongest upper bounds on the DM-neutrino cross section at $95\\%$ CL, $σ_{{\\rm DM}\\text{-}ν,0}&lt; 4\\times 10^{-34}\\ {\\rm cm^2}\\ (m_{\\rm DM}/{\\rm GeV})$, $σ_{{\\rm DM}\\text{-}ν,2}&lt; 10^{-46}\\ {\\rm cm^2}\\ (m_{\\rm DM}/{\\rm GeV})(E_ν/E_ν^0)^2$ and $σ_{{\\rm DM}\\text{-}ν,4}&lt; 7\\times 10^{-59}\\ {\\rm cm^2}\\ (m_{\\rm DM}/{\\rm GeV})(E_ν/E_ν^0)^4$.\n",
      "6        Numerous observations suggest that there exist undiscovered beyond-the-Standard-Model particles and fields. Because of their unknown nature, these exotic particles and fields could interact with Standard Model particles in many different ways and assume a variety of possible configurations. Here we present an overview of the Global Network of Optical Magnetometers for Exotic physics searches (GNOME), our ongoing experimental program designed to test a wide range of exotic physics scenarios. The GNOME experiment utilizes a worldwide network of shielded atomic magnetometers (and, more recently, comagnetometers) to search for spatially and temporally correlated signals due to torques on atomic spins from exotic fields of astrophysical origin. We survey the temporal characteristics of a variety of possible signals currently under investigation such as those from topological defect <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> (axion-like particle domain walls), axion-like particle stars, solitons of complex-valued scalar fields (Q-balls), stochastic fluctuations of bosonic <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> fields, a solar axion-like particle halo, and bursts of ultralight bosonic fields produced by cataclysmic astrophysical events such as binary black hole mergers.\n",
      "7        Recent observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) are yielding tantalizing hints of an early population of massive, bright galaxies at $z &gt; 10$, with Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) observations indicating significant dust masses in place as early as $z\\sim 7$. To understand the implications of these observations, we use the DELPHI semi-analytic model that jointly tracks the assembly of <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halos and their constituent baryons, including the key processes of dust enrichment. Our model employs only two redshift- and mass-independent free parameters that are tuned against all available galaxy data at $z \\sim 5-9$ before it is used to make predictions up to $z \\sim 20$. Our key results are: (1) the model progressively under-predicts the observed ultraviolet luminosity function (UV LF) at $z &gt; 12$; observations at $z&gt;16$ lie close to, or even above, a &#34;maximal&#34; model where all available gas is turned into stars; (2) UV selection would miss 34% of the star formation rate density at $z \\sim 5$, decreasing to 17% by $z \\sim 10$ for bright galaxies with $\\rm{M_{UV}} &lt; -19$; (3) the dust mass ($M_d$) evolves with the stellar mass ($M_*$) and redshift as $\\log(M_d) = 1.194\\log(M_*) + 0.0975z - 5.433$; (4) the escape fraction of UV photons ($f_{\\rm esc}^{\\rm UV}$) decreases with increasing mass and star formation rate. At $z \\sim 7$, $f_{\\rm esc}^{\\rm UV} \\sim 0.8~(0.1)$ for $M_* \\sim 10^9~ (10^{11}) \\, M_\\odot$ galaxies; (5) the dust temperature increases with stellar mass, ranging between $30-33$ K for $M_* \\sim 10^{9-11}M_\\odot$ galaxies at $z \\sim 7$. Finally, we predict the far infrared (FIR) LF at $z \\sim 5-20$, testable with ALMA observations, and caution that spectroscopic redshifts and dust masses must be pinned down before invoking unphysical extrema in galaxy formation models.\n",
      "8        We reexamine the consequences of perturbative unitarity on <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> freeze-out when both Sommerfeld enhancement and bound state formation affect <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> annihilations. At leading order (LO) the annihilation cross-section is infrared dominated and the connection between the unitarity bound and the upper bound on the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> mass depends only on how the different partial waves are populated. We compute how this picture is modified at next-to-leading order (NLO) with the goal of assigning a reliable theory uncertainty to the freeze-out predictions. We explicitly compute NLO corrections in a simple model with abelian gauge interactions and provide an estimate of the theoretical uncertainty for the thermal masses of heavy electroweak $n$-plets. Along the way, we clarify the regularization and matching procedure necessary to deal with singular potentials in quantum mechanics with a calculable relativistic UV completion.\n",
      "9        We provide an algorithm for evolving general spin-$s$ Gross-Pitaevskii / non-linear Schrödinger systems carrying a variety of interactions, where the $2s+1$ components of the `spinor&#39; field represent the different spin-multiplicity states. We consider many nonrelativistic interactions up to quartic order in the Schrödinger field (both short and long-range, and spin-dependent and spin-independent interactions), including explicit spin-orbit couplings. The algorithm allows for spatially varying external and/or self-generated vector potentials that couple to the spin density of the field. Our work can be used for scenarios ranging from laboratory systems such as spinor Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs), to cosmological/astrophysical systems such as self-interacting bosonic <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>. As examples, we provide results for two different setups of spin-$1$ BECs that employ a varying magnetic field and spin-orbit coupling, respectively, and also collisions of spin-$1$ solitons in <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>. Our symplectic algorithm is second-order accurate in time, and is extensible to the known higher-order accurate methods.\n",
      "10        We discuss the production of primordial black holes in an early <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> dominated era, which typically takes place in string inspired early universe cosmological models. In particular, we consider a pre-big bang scenario (extending previous results regarding formation in the radiation dominated era) where the enhancement of curvature perturbations is induced by a variation of the sound-speed parameter c_s during the string phase of high-curvature inflation. After imposing all relevant observational constraints, we find that the considered class of models is compatible with the production of a large amount of primordial black holes, in the mass range relevant to <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>, only for a small range of the parameters space. On the other hand, we find that a huge production of light primordial black holes may occur both in such <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> dominated era and in the radiation dominated one.\n",
      "11        We explore an extension of the standard $Λ$CDM model by including an interaction between neutrinos and <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>, and making use of the ground based telescope data of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT). An indication for a non-zero coupling between <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> and neutrinos (both assuming a temperature independent and $T^2$ dependent cross-section) is obtained at the 1$σ$ level coming from the ACT CMB data alone and when combined with the Planck CMB and Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) measurements. This result is confirmed by both fixing the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom in the early Universe to the Standard Model value of $N_{\\rm eff}=3.044$, and allowing $N_{\\rm eff}$ to be a free cosmological parameter. Furthermore, when performing a Bayesian model comparison, the interacting $ν$DM (+$N_{\\rm eff}$) scenario is mostly preferred over a baseline $Λ$CDM (+$N_{\\rm eff}$) cosmology. The preferred value is then used as a benchmark and the potential implications of <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter&#39;s</span> interaction with a sterile neutrino are discussed.\n",
      "12        We present an innovative approach to constraining the non-cold <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> model using a convolutional neural network (CNN). We perform a suite of hydrodynamic simulations with varying <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> particle masses and generate mock 21cm radio intensity maps to trace the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> distribution. Our proposed method complements the traditional power spectrum analysis. We compare our CNN classification results with those from the power spectrum of the differential brightness temperature map of 21cm radiation, and find that the CNN outperforms the latter. Moreover, we investigate the impact of baryonic physics on the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> model constraint, including star formation, self-shielding of HI gas, and UV background model. We find that these effects may introduce some contamination in the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> constraint, but they are insignificant when compared to the realistic system noise of the SKA instruments.\n",
      "13        The <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> power spectrum has been strongly constrained by astronomical measurements at large scales, but only weakly at small scales. Compared with the standard scenario, the deviation of the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> power spectrum at small scales has influence on the cosmological structure formation, e.g., the comoving number density of <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halos. The thermal history of the intergalactic medium (IGM) can be changed if <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> is made of weakly interacting massive particles and can annihilate into standard model particles. The changes of the evolution of IGM could leave imprints on the relevant astronomical observations. Taking into account the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> annihilation, we investigate the impact of the deviation of <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> power spectrum at small scales on the global 21-cm signal. In view of the measurements of the global 21-cm signal by the EDGES experiment, we explore the allowed parameter space of $m_s$, which describes the degree of deviation, by requiring the differential brightness temperature of the global 21-cm signal $δT_{21} \\le -50~\\rm mK$ at redshift $z=17$.\n",
      "14        Using Low Brightness Surface Galaxies (LBSG) rotational curves we inferred the free parameters of $\\ell$-boson stars as a <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> component. The $\\ell$-boson stars are numerical solutions to the non-relativistic limit of the Einstein-Klein-Gordon system, the Schrödinger-Poisson (SP) system. These solutions are parametrized by an angular momentum number $\\ell = (N-1)/2$ and an excitation number $n$. We perform a bayesian analysis by modifying the SimpleMC code to perform the parameter inference, for the cases with $\\ell = 0$, $\\ell = 1$ and multistates of $\\ell$-boson stars. We used the Akaike information criterion (AIC), Bayesian information criterion and the Bayes factor to compare the excited state ($\\ell$=1) and the multistate case with the ground state ($\\ell$=0) as the base model due to its simplicity. We found that the data in most galaxies in the sample favours the multistates case and that the scalar field mass tends to be slightly bigger than the ground state case.\n",
      "15        A long-standing observed curiosity of globular clusters (GCs) has been that both the number and total mass of GCs in a galaxy are linearly correlated with the galaxy&#39;s virial mass, whereas its stellar component shows no such linear correlation. This work expands on an empirical model for the numbers and ages of GCs in galaxies presented by Valenzuela et al. (2021) that is consistent with recent observational data from massive elliptical galaxies down to the dwarf galaxy regime. Applying the model to simulations, GC numbers are shown to be excellent tracers for the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> (DM) virial mass, even when distinct formation mechanisms are employed for blue and red GCs. Furthermore, the amount of DM smooth accretion is encoded in the GC abundances, therefore providing a measure for an otherwise nearly untraceable component of the formation history of galaxies.\n",
      "16        We analytically solve the problem of Bose star growth in the bath of gravitationally interacting particles. We find that after nucleation of this object, the bath is described by a self-similar solution of the kinetic equation, which is an attractor. Together with the conservation laws, this fixes mass evolution of the Bose star. Our results explain slowdown of the star growth at a certain &#34;core-halo&#34; mass, but also predict formation of the heavier and lighter objects in magistral <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> models.\n",
      "17        <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">Dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> subhaloes are key for the predictions of simulations of structure formation, but their existence frequently ends prematurely due to two technical issues, namely numerical disruption in N-body simulations and halo finders failing to identify them. Here we focus on the second issue, using the phase-space friends-of-friends halo finder ROCKSTAR as a benchmark (though we expect our results to translate to comparable codes). We confirm that the most prominent cause for losing track of subhaloes is tidal distortion rather than a low number of particles. As a solution, we present a flexible post-processing algorithm that tracks all subhalo particles over time, computes subhalo positions and masses based on those particles, and progressively removes stripped <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>. If a subhalo is lost by the halo finder, this algorithm keeps tracking its so-called ghost until it has almost no particles left or has truly merged with its host. We apply this technique to a large suite of N-body simulations and restore lost subhaloes to the halo catalogues, which has a dramatic effect on key summary statistics of large-scale structure. Specifically, the subhalo mass function increases by about 50% and the halo correlation function increases by a factor of two at small scales. While these quantitative results are somewhat specific to our algorithm, they demonstrate that particle tracking is a promising way to reliably follow haloes and reduce the need for orphan models. Our algorithm and augmented halo catalogues are publicly available.\n",
      "18        Ultralight bosons are predicted in many extensions to the Standard Model and are popular <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> candidates. The black hole superradiance mechanism allows for these particles to be probed using only their gravitational interaction. In this scenario, an ultralight boson cloud may form spontaneously around a spinning black hole and extract a non-negligible fraction of the black hole&#39;s mass. These oscillating clouds produce quasi-monochromatic, long-duration gravitational waves that may be detectable by ground-based or space-based gravitational wave detectors. We discuss the capability of a new long-duration signal tracking method, based on a hidden Markov model, to detect gravitational wave signals generated by ultralight vector boson clouds, including cases where the signal frequency evolution timescale is much shorter than that of a typical continuous wave signal. We quantify the detection horizon distances for vector boson clouds with current- and next-generation ground-based detectors. We demonstrate that vector clouds hosted by black holes with mass $\\gtrsim 60 M_{\\odot}$ and spin $\\gtrsim 0.6$ are within the reach of current-generation detectors up to a luminosity distance of $\\sim 1$ Gpc. This search method enables one to target vector boson clouds around remnant black holes from compact binary mergers detected by gravitational-wave detectors. We discuss the impact of the sky localization of the merger events and demonstrate that a typical remnant black hole reasonably well-localized by the current generation detector network is accessible in a follow-up search.\n",
      "19        Lithium-drifted silicon [Si(Li)] has been used for decades as an ionizing radiation detector in nuclear, particle, and astrophysical experiments, though such detectors have frequently been limited to small sizes (few cm$^2$) and cryogenic operating temperatures. The 10-cm-diameter Si(Li) detectors developed for the General Antiparticle Spectrometer (GAPS) balloon-borne <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> experiment are novel particularly for their requirements of low cost, large sensitive area (~10 m$^2$ for the full 1440-detector array), high temperatures (near -40$\\,^\\circ$C), and energy resolution below 4 keV FWHM for 20--100-keV x-rays. Previous works have discussed the manufacturing, passivation, and small-scale testing of prototype GAPS Si(Li) detectors. Here we show for the first time the results from detailed characterization of over 1100 flight detectors, illustrating the consistent intrinsic low-noise performance of a large sample of GAPS detectors. This work demonstrates the feasibility of large-area and low-cost Si(Li) detector arrays for next-generation astrophysics and nuclear physics applications.\n",

The boosted <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">Dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">Matter</span> flux at the edge of the Earth&#39;s atmosphere is expected to be pointing to the Galactic Center, with a flux 15 to 20 times larger than in the transverse direction.\n",
      "21        We investigate the reach of future gravitational wave (GW) detectors in probing inflaton couplings with visible sector particles that can either be bosonic or fermionic in nature. Assuming reheating takes place through perturbative quantum production from vacuum in presence of classical inflaton background field, we find that the spectral energy density of the primordial GW generated during inflation becomes sensitive to inflaton-<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> coupling. We conclude, obeying bounds from Big Bang Nucleosysthesis and Cosmic Microwave Background, that, e.g., inflaton-scalar couplings of the order of $\\sim\\mathcal{O}(10^{-20})$ GeV fall within the sensitivity range of several proposed GW detector facilities. However, this prediction is sensitive to the size of the inflationary scale, nature of the inflaton-<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> interaction and shape of the potential during reheating. Having found the time-dependent effective inflaton decay width, we also discuss its implications for <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> (DM) production from the thermal plasma via UV freeze-in during reheating. It is shown, that one can reproduce the observed DM abundance for its mass up to several PeVs, depending on the dimension of the operator connecting DM with the thermal bath and the associated scale of the UV physics. Thus we promote primordial GW to observables sensitive to feebly coupled inflaton, which is very challenging if not impossible to test in conventional particle physics laboratories or astrophysical measurements.\n",
      "22        We argue that demanding a consistent cosmological history, including the absence of domain walls and strongly interacting relics at the Peccei-Quinn scale, singles out two concrete realizations of hadronic QCD axions as viable <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> models. These realizations generally feature flavor-violating axion couplings to Standard Model quarks that are unsuppressed at low energies. As a consequence, experiments looking for flavor-violating hadronic processes involving the axion can be sensitive probes of QCD axion <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> models. In particular, we show that the NA62 and KOTO experiments could detect the $K\\rightarrowπ+ a$ decay for axions consistent with the observed <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> abundance via the post-inflationary misalignment mechanism.\n",
      "23        The mean <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> density within the turnaround radius, which is the boundary that separates a nonexpanding structure from the Hubble flow, was recently proposed as a novel cosmological probe. According to the spherical collapse model, the evolution with cosmic time of this turnaround density, $\\rm ρ_{ta}(z)$, can be used to determine both $\\rm Ω_m$ and $Ω_Λ$, independently of any other currently used probe. The properties of $\\rm ρ_{ta}$ predicted by the spherical collapse model were also shown to persist in the presence of full three-dimensional effects in $\\rm Λ$CDM N-body cosmological simulations when considering galaxy clusters at the present time, $z=0$. However, a small offset was discovered between the spherical-collapse prediction of the value of $ρ_{ta}$ at $z=0$ and its value measured in simulations. In this letter, we explore whether this offset evolves with cosmic time; whether it differs in different cosmologies; whether its origin can be confidently identified; and whether it can be corrected. We found that the offset does evolve slightly with redshift, and that it correlates strongly with the deviation from spherical symmetry of the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halo distribution inside and outside of the turnaround radius. We used an appropriate metric to quantify deviations in the environment of a structure from spherical symmetry. We found that using this metric, we can construct a sphericity-selected sample of halos for which the offset of $ρ_{ta}$ from the spherical collapse prediction is zero, independently of redshift and cosmology. We found that a sphericity-selected halo sample allows us to recover the simulated cosmology, and we conclude that the turnaround density evolution indeed encodes the cosmology in N-body simulations.\n",
      "24        We present a new suite of over 1,500 cosmological N-body simulations with varied Warm <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">Dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">Matter</span> (WDM) models ranging from 2.5 to 30 keV. We use these simulations to train Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to infer WDM particle masses from images of DM field data. Our fiducial setup can make accurate predictions of the WDM particle mass up to 7.5 keV at a 95% confidence level from small maps that cover an area of (25 h$^{-1}$ Mpc)$^2$. We vary the image resolution, simulation resolution, redshift, and cosmology of our fiducial setup to better understand how our model is making predictions. Using these variations, we find that our models are most dependent on simulation resolution, minimally dependent on image resolution, not systematically dependent on redshift, and robust to varied cosmologies. We also find that an important feature to distinguish between WDM models is present with a linear size between 100 and 200 h$^{-1}$ kpc. We compare our fiducial model to one trained on the power spectrum alone and find that our field-level model can make 2x more precise predictions and can make accurate predictions to 2x as massive WDM particle masses when used on the same data. Overall, we find that the field-level data can be used to accurately differentiate between WDM models and contain more information than is captured by the power spectrum. This technique can be extended to more complex DM models and opens up new opportunities to explore alternative DM models in a cosmological environment.\n",
      "25        The properties of globular clusters (GCs) contain valuable information of their host galaxies and <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span>-<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halos. In the remarkable example of ultra-diffuse galaxy, NGC5846-UDG1, the GC population exhibits strong radial mass segregation, indicative of dynamical-friction-driven orbital decay, which opens the possibility of using imaging data alone to constrain the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span>-<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> content of the galaxy. To explore this possibility, we develop a semi-analytical model of GC evolution, which starts from the initial mass function, the initial structure-mass relation, and the initial spatial distribution of the GC progenitors, and follows the effects of dynamical friction, tidal evolution, and two-body relaxation. Using Markov Chain Monte Carlo, we forward-model the GCs in a NGC5846-UDG1-like potential to match the observed GC mass, size, and spatial distributions, and to constrain the profile of the host halo and the origin of the GCs. We find that, with the assumptions of zero mass segregation when the star clusters were born, NGC5846-UDG1 is <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span>-<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> poor compared to what is expected from stellar-to-halo-mass relations, and its halo concentration is low, irrespective of having a cuspy or a cored halo profile. Its GC population has an initial spatial distribution more extended than the smooth stellar distribution. We discuss the results in the context of scaling laws of galaxy-halo connections, and warn against naively using the GC-abundance-halo-mass relation to infer the halo mass of UDGs. Our model is generally applicable to GC-rich dwarf galaxies, and is publicly available at https://github.com/JiangFangzhou/GCevo.\n",
      "26        The Epoch of Reionization (EoR) neutral Hydrogen (HI) 21-cm signal evolves significantly along the line-of-sight (LoS) due to the light-cone (LC) effect. It is important to accurately incorporate this in simulations in order to correctly interpret the signal. 21-cm LC simulations are typically produced by stitching together slices from a finite number $(N_{\\rm RS})$ of &#39;&#39;reionization snapshot&#39;&#39;, each corresponding to a different stage of reionization. In this paper, we have quantified the errors in the 21-cm LC simulation due to the finite value of $N_{\\rm RS}$. We show that this can introduce large discontinuities $(&gt; 200 \\%)$ at the stitching boundaries when $N_{\\rm RS}$ is small $(= 2,4)$ and the mean neutral fraction jumps by $δ\\bar{x}_{\\rm HI} = 0.2,0.1$ respectively at the stitching boundaries. This drops to $17 \\%$ for $N_{\\rm RS} = 13$ where $δ\\bar{x}_{\\rm HI}=0.02$. We present and also validate a method for mitigating this error by increasing $N_{\\rm RS}$ without a proportional increase in the computational costs which are mainly incurred in generating the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> and halo density fields. Our method generates these fields only at a few redshifts, and interpolates them to generate reionization snapshots at closely spaced redshifts. We use this to generate 21-cm LC simulations with $N_{\\rm RS} = 26,51,101$ and $201$, and show that the errors go down as $N_{\\rm RS}^{-1}$.\n",
      "27        The advent of gravitational wave astronomy has seen a huge influx of new predictions for potential discoveries of beyond the Standard Model fields. The coupling of all fundamental fields to gravity, together with its dominance on large scales, makes gravitational physics a rich laboratory to study fundamental physics. This holds especially true for the search for the elusive <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> photon, a promising <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> candidate. The <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> photon is predicted to generate instabilities in a rotating black hole spacetime, birthing a macroscopic Bose-Einstein condensate. These condensates can especially form around super massive black holes, modifying the dynamical inspiralling process. This then opens another window to leverage future space-borne gravitational wave antennas to join the hunt for the elusive <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> particle. This study builds a preliminary model for the gravitational waveform emitted by such a dressed extreme mass-ratio inspiral. Comparing these waveforms to the vacuum scenario allows projections to the potential constrainability on the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> photon mass by space-borne gravitational wave antennas. The superradiant instability of a massive vector field on a Kerr background is calculated and the modification to the dynamics of an inspiralling solar mass-scale compact object is determined with approximations on the backreaction effect of the cloud on the compact object. The end result is the projection that the LISA mission should be able to constrain the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> photon mass using extreme mass ratio inspirals in the range $[1.8 \\times 10^{-17}, 4.47 \\times 10^{-16}]$ eV.\n",
      "28        Recent observations made by the JWST have revealed a number of massive galaxies at high redshift ($z$). The presence of these galaxies appears at odds with the current $Λ$CDM cosmology. Here we investigate the possibility of alleviating the tension by incorporating uncertainties from three sources in counting massive galaxies at high $z$: cosmic variance, error in stellar mass estimate, and contribution by backsplash. We find that each of the sources can significantly increase the cumulative stellar mass density $ρ_*(&gt;M_*)$ at the high-mass end, and the combination of them can boost the density by more than one order of magnitude. Assuming a star formation efficiency of $ε_* \\sim 0.5$, cosmic variance alone can reduce the tension to $2σ$ level, except the most massive galaxy at $z=8$. Including in addition a lognormal dispersion with a width of 0.3 dex in the stellar mass can bring the observed stellar mass density at $z \\sim 7 - 10$ to the $2σ$ range of the cosmic variance. The tension is completely eliminated when gas stripped from backsplash halos is also taken into account. Our results highlight the importance of fully modeling uncertainties when interpreting observational data of rare objects. We use the constrained simulation, ELUCID, to investigate the descendants of high $z$ massive galaxies. We find that a significant portion of these galaxies end up in massive halos with mass $M_{\\rm halo} &gt; 10^{13} h^{-1}M_\\odot $ at $z=0$. A large fraction of central galaxies in $M_{\\rm halo} \\geqslant 10^{14.5} h^{-1}M_\\odot$ halos today are predicted to contain significant amounts of ancient stars formed in massive galaxies at $z\\sim 8$. This prediction can be tested by studying the structure and stellar population of central galaxies in present-day massive clusters.\n",
      "29        Within the $Λ$CDM cosmology, <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> haloes are comprised of both a smooth component and a population of smaller, gravitationally bound subhaloes. These components are often treated as a single halo when halo properties, such as density profiles, are extracted from simulations. Recent work has shown that density profiles change substantially when subhalo mass is excluded. In this paper, we expand on this result by analysing the change in three specific host halo properties -- concentration ($c_{\\rm{NFW}}$), spin ($λ_{\\rm Bullock}$), and shape ($c/a$), -- when calculated only from the smooth component of the halo. This analysis is performed on both Milky Way-mass haloes and cluster-mass haloes in high-resolution, zoom-in, $N$-body simulations. We find that when subhaloes are excluded the median value of (1) $c_{\\rm{NFW}}$ is enhanced by $\\approx 38 \\pm 12\\%$ and $\\approx 88 \\pm 7.7\\%$ for Milky Way mass ($10^{12.1}\\,\\text{M}_\\odot$) and cluster mass ($10^{14.8}\\,\\text{M}_\\odot$) haloes respectively, (2) $λ_{\\rm Bullock}$ is reduced for Milky Way mass by $\\approx 16 \\pm 6.8\\%$ and cluster mass haloes by $\\approx 32 \\pm 8.9\\%$. Additionally, with the removal of subhaloes, cluster mass haloes tend to become more spherical as the ratio of minor-to-major axis, $c/a$, increases by $\\approx 12 \\pm 4\\%$, whereas Milky Way mass haloes remain approximately the same shape with $c/a$ changed by $\\approx 1.2 \\pm 5.6\\%$. The fractional change of each of these properties depends primarily on the amount of mass that is removed from the halo system and, to a lesser extent, mass accretion history. Our findings demonstrate that the properties of the smooth components of <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> haloes are biased relative to the total mass of the halo including subhaloes.\n",
      "30        In order to test active galactic nucleus (AGN) unification and evolutionary models, we measured the AGN clustering properties as a function of AGN obscuration defined in terms of hydrogen column density, $N_{\\rm H}$. In addition to measuring the clustering of unobscured ($N_{\\rm H} &lt; 10^{22}\\,{\\rm cm}^{-2}$) and moderately obscured ($10^{22} \\leq N_{\\rm H} &lt; 10^{23.5}$) AGNs, we also targeted highly obscured sources ($N_{\\rm H}\\geq 10^{23.5}$) up to redshifts of $z=3$. We have compiled one of the largest samples of X-ray-selected AGNs from a total of eight deep XMM/Chandra surveys. We measured the clustering as a function of both AGN obscuration and redshift using the projected two-point correlation function, $w_{\\rm p}(r_{\\rm p})$. We modeled the large-scale clustering signal, measured the AGN bias, $b(z, N_{\\rm H})$, and interpreted it in terms of the typical AGN host <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halo, $M_{\\rm halo}(z, N_{\\rm H}$). We find no significant dependence of AGN clustering on obscuration, suggesting similar typical masses of the hosting halos as a function of $N_{\\rm H}$. This result matches expectations of AGN unification models, in which AGN obscuration depends mainly on the viewing angle of the obscuring torus. We measured, for the first time, the clustering of highly obscured AGNs and find that these objects reside in halos with typical mass $\\log M_{\\rm halo} = 12.98_{-0.22}^{+0.17} [h^{-1} M_\\odot]$ ($12.28_{-0.19}^{+0.13}$) at low $z \\sim 0.7$ (high $z \\sim 1.8$) redshifts. We find that irrespective of obscuration, an increase in AGN bias with redshift is slower than the expectation for a constant halo mass and instead follows the growth rate of halos, known as the passive evolution track. This implies that for those AGNs the clustering is mainly driven by the mass growth rate of the hosting halos and galaxies across cosmic time.\n",
      "31        Mergers between galaxy clusters are an important stage in the formation of the large-scale structure of the Universe. Some of the mergers show a spectacular bow shock that formed as a result of recent passage of a smaller cluster through a bigger one, the classic example of this being the so-called bullet cluster. In this paper, I describe ten examples of interacting clusters identified among 200 of the most massive objects, with total masses above $1.4 \\times 10^{14}$ M$_{\\odot}$, from the IllustrisTNG300 simulation by searching for prominent bow shocks in their temperature maps. Despite different mass ratios of the two merging clusters, the events are remarkably similar in many respects. In all cases, the companion cluster passed close to the main one only once, between 0.9 and 0.3 Gyr ago, with the pericenter distance of 100-530 kpc and a velocity of up to 3400 km s$^{-1}$. The subcluster, typically an order of magnitude smaller in mass than the main cluster before the interaction, loses most of its <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> and gas in the process. The displacement between the collisionless part of the remnant and the bow shock is such that the remnant typically lags behind the shock or coincides with it, with a single exception of the merger occurring with the largest velocity. Usually about 1% of the gas cells in the merging clusters are shocked, and the median Mach numbers of these gas cells are around two. Due to the relatively small size of the simulation box, no close analog of the bullet cluster was found, but I identified one case that is similar in terms of mass, velocity, and displacement. The presented cases bear more resemblance to less extreme observed interacting clusters such as A520 and Coma.\n",
      "32        Microscopic horizonless relics could form in the early universe either directly through gravitational collapse or as stable remnants of the Hawking evaporation of primordial black holes. In both cases they completely or partially evade cosmological constraints arising from Hawking evaporation and in certain mass ranges can explain the entirety of the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>. We systematically explore the stochastic gravitational-wave background associated with the formation of microscopic <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span>-<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> relics in various scenarios, adopting an agnostic approach and discussing the limitations introduced by existing constraints, possible ways to circumvent the latter, and expected astrophysical foregrounds. Interestingly, this signal is at most marginally detectable with current interferometers but could be detectable by third-generations instruments such as the Einstein Telescope, strengthening their potential as discovery machines.\n",
      "33        In direct <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> (DM) detection via scattering off the electrons, the momentum transfer plays a crucial role. Previous work showed that for self-interacting DM, if the DM particle has a size (the so-called puffy DM), the radius effect could dominate the momentum transfer and become another source of velocity dependence for self-scattering cross section. In this work we investigate the direct detection of puffy DM particles with different radii through electron recoil. We find that comparing with the available experimental exclusion limits dominated by the mediator effect for XENON10, XENON100 and XENON1T, the constraints on the puffy DM-electron scattering cross-section become much weaker for large radius DM particles. For small-radius DM particles, the constraints remain similar to the point-like DM case.\n",
      "34        Boson stars are gravitationally bound objects that arise in ultralight <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> models and form in the centers of galactic halos or axion miniclusters. We systematically study the excitations of a boson star, taking into account the mixing between positive and negative frequencies introduced by gravity. We show that the spectrum contains zero-energy modes in the monopole and dipole sectors resulting from spontaneous symmetry breaking by the boson star background. We analyze the general properties of the eigenmodes and derive their orthogonality and completeness conditions which have non-standard form due to the positive-negative frequency mixing. The eigenvalue problem is solved numerically for the first few energy levels in different multipole sectors and the results are compared to the solutions of the Schrödinger equation in fixed boson star gravitational potential. The two solutions differ significantly for the lowest modes, but get close for higher levels. We further confirm the normal mode spectrum in 3D wave simulations where we inject perturbations with different multipoles. As an application of the normal mode solutions, we compute the matrix element entering the evaporation rate of a boson star immersed in a hot axion gas. The computation combines the use of exact wavefunctions for the low-lying bound states and of the Schrödinger approximation for the high-energy excitations.\n",
      "35        If long-range attractive forces exist and are stronger than gravity then cosmic halo formation can begin in the radiation-dominated era. We study a simple realization of this effect in a system where <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> fermions have Yukawa interactions mediated by scalar particles, analogous to the Higgs boson in the standard model. We develop a self-consistent description of the system including exact background dynamics of the scalar field, and precise modelling of the fermion density fluctuations. For the latter, we provide accurate approximations for the linear growth as well as quantitative modelling of the nonlinear evolution using N-body simulations. We find that halo formation occurs exponentially fast and on scales substantially larger than simple estimates predict. The final fate of these halos remains uncertain, but could be annihilation, <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> stars, primordial black holes, or even the existence of galaxy-sized halos at <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>-radiation equality. More generally, our results demonstrate the importance of mapping scalar-mediated interactions onto structure formation outcomes and constraints for beyond the standard model theories.\n",
      "36        Recent analysis on the stellar kinematics of ultra-faint dwarf (UFD) galaxies has put a stringent upper limit on the self-scattering cross section of <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>, i.e., $σ/m&lt;{\\cal O}(0.1)\\,{\\rm cm^2/g}$ at the scattering velocity of ${\\cal O}(10)\\,{\\rm km/s}$. Resonant self-interacting <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> (rSIDM) is one possibility that can be consistent with the UFDs and explain the low central densities of rotation-supported galaxies; the cross section is resonantly enhanced to be $σ/m = {\\cal O}(1)\\,{\\rm cm^2/g}$ around the scattering velocity of ${\\cal O}(100)\\,{\\rm km/s}$ while being suppressed at lower velocities. To further assess this possibility, since the inferred <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> distribution of halos from astrophysical observations is usually compared to that in constant-cross section SIDM (cSIDM), whether the structures of rSIDM halos can be approximated by the cSIDM halo profiles needs to be clarified. In this work, we employ the grovothermal fluid method to investigate the structural evolution of rSIDM halos in a wide mass range. We find that except for halos in a specific mass range, the present structures of rSIDM halos are virtually indistinguishable from those of the cSIDM halos. For halos in the specific mass range, the resonant self-scattering renders a break in their density profile. We demonstrate how such a density-profile break appears in astrophysical observations, e.g., rotation curves and line-of-sight velocity dispersion profiles. We show that for halos above the specific mass range, the density-profile break thermalizes to disappear before the present. We demonstrate that such distinctive thermalization dynamics can leave imprints on the orbital classes of stars with similar ages and metallicities.\n",
      "37        The E-type $α$-attractor models of single-field inflation were generalized further in order to accommodate production of primordial black holes (PBH) via adding a near-inflection point to the inflaton scalar potential at smaller scales, in good agreement with measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation. A minimal number of new parameters was used but their fine-tuning was maximized in order to increase possible masses of PBH formed during an ultra-slow-roll phase leading to a large enhancement of the power spectrum of scalar (curvature) perturbations by 6 or 7 orders of magnitude against the power spectrum of perturbations observed in CMB. It was found that extreme fine-tuning of the parameters in our models can lead to a formation of the Earth-size PBH with the masses of approximately $10^{27}$ g, still in agreement with CMB observations. Quantum corrections are known to lead to the perturbative upper bound on the amplitude of large scalar perturbations responsible for PBH production. The quantum (one-loop) corrections in our models were found to be suppressed by one order of magnitude for PBH with the masses of approximately $10^{19}$ g, which may form the whole <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> in the Universe.\n",
      "38        We discuss in detail the possibility that the &#34;type-II majoron&#34; -- that is, the pseudo Nambu-Goldstone boson that arises in the context of the type-II seesaw mechanism if the lepton number is spontaneously broken by an additional singlet scalar -- account for the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> (DM) observed in the universe. We study the requirements the model&#39;s parameters have to fulfill in order to reproduce the measured DM relic abundance through two possible production mechanisms in the early universe, freeze-in and misalignment, both during a standard radiation-dominated era and early <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> domination. We then study possible signals of type-II majoron DM and the present and expected constraints on the parameter space that can be obtained from cosmological observations, direct detection experiments, and present and future searches for decaying DM at neutrino telescopes and cosmic-ray experiments. We find that -- depending on the majoron mass, the production mechanism, and the value of the vacuum expectation value of the type-II triplet -- all of the three decay modes (photons, electrons, neutrinos) of majoron DM particles can yield observable signals at future indirect searches for DM. Furthermore, in a corner of the parameter space, detection of majoron DM is possible through electron recoil at running and future direct detection experiments.\n",
      "39        Running vacuum models and viscous <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> scenarios beyond perfect fluid idealization are two appealing theoretical strategies that have been separately studied as alternatives to solve some problems rooted in the $Λ$CDM cosmological model. In this paper, we combine these two notions in a single cosmological setting and investigate their cosmological implications, paying particular attention in the interplay between these two constituents in different cosmological periods. Specifically, we consider a well-studied running vacuum model inspired by renormalization group, and a recently proposed general parameterization for the bulk viscosity $ξ$. By employing dynamical system analysis, we explore the physical aspects of the new phase space that emerges from the combined models and derive stability conditions that ensure complete cosmological dynamics. We identify four distinct classes of models and find that the critical points of the phase space are non-trivially renewed compared to the single scenarios. We then proceed, in a joint and complementary way to the dynamical system analysis, with a detailed numerical exploration to quantify the impact of both the running parameter and the bulk viscosity coefficient on the cosmological evolution. Thus, for some values of the model parameters, numerical solutions show qualitative differences from the $Λ$CDM model, which is phenomenologically appealing in light of cosmological observations.\n",
      "40        The intrinsic alignment (IA) of observed galaxy shapes with the underlying cosmic web is a source of contamination in weak lensing surveys. Sensitive methods to identify the IA signal will therefore need to be included in the upcoming weak lensing analysis pipelines. Hydrodynamical cosmological simulations allow us to directly measure the intrinsic ellipticities of galaxies and thus provide a powerful approach to predict and understand the IA signal. Here we employ the novel, large-volume hydrodynamical simulation MTNG740, a product of the MillenniumTNG (MTNG) project, to study the IA of galaxies. We measure the projected correlation functions between the intrinsic shape/shear of galaxies and various tracers of large-scale structure, $w_{+g},\\ w_{+m},\\ w_{++}$ over the radial range $r_{\\rm p} \\in [0.02 , 200]\\,h^{-1}{\\rm Mpc}$ and at redshifts $z=0.0$, $0.5$ and $1.0$. We detect significant signal-to-noise IA signals with the density field for both elliptical and spiral galaxies. We also find significant intrinsic shear-shear correlations for ellipticals. We further examine correlations of the intrinsic shape of galaxies with the local tidal field. Here we find a significant IA signal for elliptical galaxies assuming a linear model. We also detect a weak IA signal for spiral galaxies under a quadratic tidal torquing model. Lastly, we measure the alignment between central galaxies and their host <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span>-<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halos, finding small to moderate misalignments between their principal axes that decline with halo mass.\n",

We explore the lensing maps over a large dynamic range in simulation mass and angular resolution, allowing us to establish a clear assessment of numerical convergence. By comparing full physics hydrodynamical simulations with corresponding <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span>-<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>-only runs we quantify the impact of baryonic physics on the most important weak lensing statistics. Likewise, we predict the impact of massive neutrinos reliably far into the non-linear regime. We also demonstrate that the &#34;fixed &amp; paired&#34; variance suppression technique increases the statistical robustness of the simulation predictions on large scales not only for time slices but also for continuously output lightcone data. We find that both baryonic and neutrino effects substantially impact weak lensing shear measurements, with the latter dominating over the former on large angular scales. Thus, both effects must explicitly be included to obtain sufficiently accurate predictions for stage IV lensing surveys. Reassuringly, our results agree accurately with other simulation results where available, supporting the promise of simulation modelling for precision cosmology far into the non-linear regime.\n",

Furthermore, <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> density perturbations that enter the horizon during an era of kination grow linearly with the scale factor prior to radiation domination. We show how the resulting enhancement to the small-scale <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> power spectrum increases the microhalo abundance and boosts the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> annihilation rate. We then use gamma-ray observations to constrain thermal <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> production during kination. The annihilation boost factor depends on the minimum halo mass, which is determined by the small-scale cutoff in the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> power spectrum. Therefore, observational limits on the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> annihilation rate imply a minimum cutoff scale for a given <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> particle mass and kination scenario.

      "43        We present the measurement of total and stellar/<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> decomposed mass density profile around a sample of galaxy groups and clusters with dynamical masses derived from integral-field stellar kinematics from the MaNGA survey in Paper~I and weak lensing derived from the DECaLS imaging survey. Combining the two data sets enables accurate measurement of the radial density distribution from several kpc to Mpc scales. Intriguingly, we find that the excess surface density derived from stellar kinematics in the inner region cannot be explained by simply adding an NFW <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halo extrapolated from lensing measurement at a larger scale to a stellar mass component derived from the NASA-Sloan Atlas (NSA) catalog. We find that a good fit to both data sets requires a stellar mass normalization about 3 times higher than that derived from the NSA catalog, which would require an unrealistically too-heavy initial mass function for stellar mass estimation. If we keep the stellar mass normalization to that of the NSA catalog but allow a varying inner <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> density profile, we obtain an asymptotic slope of $γ_{\\rm gnfw}$= $1.82_{-0.25}^{+0.15}$, $γ_{\\rm gnfw}$= $1.48_{-0.41}^{+0.20}$ for the group bin and the cluster bin respectively, significantly steeper than the NFW case. We also compare the total mass inner density slopes with those from Illustris-TNG300 and find that the values from the simulation are lower than the observation by at least $3σ$ level.\n",
      "44        We present dynamical scaling relations, combined with the stellar population properties, for a subsample of about 6000 nearby galaxies with the most reliable dynamical models extracted from the full MaNGA sample of 10K galaxies. We show that the inclination-corrected mass plane (MP) for both early-type galaxies (ETGs) and late-type galaxies (LTGs), which links dynamical mass, projected half-light radius $R_{\\rm e}$, and the second stellar velocity moment $σ_{\\rm e}$ within $R_{\\rm e}$, satisfies the virial theorem and is even tighter than the uncorrected one. We find a clear parabolic relation between $\\lg(M/L)(&lt;R_{\\rm e})$, the total mass-to-light ratio within a sphere of radius $R_{\\rm e}$, and $\\lgσ_{\\rm e}$, with the $M/L$ increasing with $σ_{\\rm e}$ and for older stellar populations. However, the relation for ETGs is linear and the one for the youngest galaxies is constant. We confirm and improve the relation between average logarithmic total density slopes $γ_{_{\\rm T}}$ and $σ_{\\rm e}$: $γ_{_{\\rm T}}$ become steeper with increasing $σ_{\\rm e}$ until $\\lg(σ_{\\rm e}/{\\rm km\\,s^{-1}})\\approx 2.2$ and then remain constant around $γ_{_{\\rm T}}\\approx -2.2$. The $γ_{_{\\rm T}}-σ_{\\rm e}$ variation is larger for LTGs than ETGs. At fixed $σ_{\\rm e}$ the total density profiles steepen with galaxy age and for ETGs.

The increased $f_{\\rm DM}(&lt;R_{\\rm e})$ at low $σ_{\\rm e}$ explains the parabolic $\\lg(M/L)(&lt;R_{\\rm e})-\\lgσ_{\\rm e}$ relation.\n",
      "45        We analyze the global stellar population, radial gradients and non-parametric star formation history of $\\sim 10$K galaxies from the MaNGA Survey final data release 17 (DR17), based on stellar population synthesis and full-spectrum fitting, and relate them with dynamical properties of galaxies. We confirm that stellar population correlates with stellar velocity dispersion $σ_{\\rm e}$ better than with stellar mass $M_{\\ast}$, but also find that younger galaxies are more metal-poor at fixed $σ_{\\rm e}$. Stellar age, metallicity, and mass-to-light ratio $M_{\\ast}/L$ all decrease with galaxy rotation, while radial gradients become more negative (i.e., younger, more metal-poor, and lower $M_{\\ast}/L$ in the outskirts). The trend between metallicity gradients and rotation reverses for slow rotators, which stand out for their more negative metallicity gradients than faster-rotating galaxies. We highlight a population of massive disk galaxies on the green valley, on the $(σ_{\\rm e},\\rm Age)$ plane, that show steep negative age and metallicity gradients, consistent with their old central bulges surrounded by young star-forming disks and metal-poor gas accretion. Galaxies with high $σ_{\\rm e}$, steep total mass-density slope, low <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> fraction, high $M_{\\ast}/L$, and high metallicity have the highest star-formation rate at earlier times, and are currently quenched. We discover a population of low-mass star-forming galaxies with low rotation but physically distinct from the massive slow rotators. A catalogue of the population properties is provided publicly.\n",
      "46        This is the first paper in our series on the combined analysis of the Dynamics and stellar Population (DynPop) for the MaNGA survey in the final SDSS Data Release 17 (DR17). Here we present a catalogue of dynamically-determined quantities for over 10000 nearby galaxies based on integral-field stellar kinematics from the MaNGA survey. The dynamical properties are extracted using the axisymmetric Jeans Anisotropic Modelling (JAM) method, which was previously shown to be the most accurate for this kind of study. We assess systematic uncertainties using eight dynamical models with different assumptions. We use two orientations of the velocity ellipsoid: either cylindrically-aligned JAM$_{\\rm cyl}$ or spherically-aligned JAM$_{\\rm sph}$. We also make four assumptions for the models&#39; <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> vs. luminous <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> distributions: (1) mass-follows-light, (2) free NFW <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> halo, (3) cosmologically-constrained NFW halo, (4) generalized NFW <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> halo, i.e. with free inner slope. In this catalogue, we provide the quantities related to the mass distributions (e.g. the density slopes and enclosed mass within a sphere of a given radius for total mass, stellar mass, and <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> mass components). We also provide the complete models which can be used to compute the full luminous and mass distribution of each galaxy. Additionally, we visually assess the qualities of the models to help with model selections. We estimate the observed scatter in the measured quantities which decreases as expected with improvements in quality. For the best data quality, we find a remarkable consistency of measured quantities between different models, highlighting the robustness of the results.\n",
      "47        What is the highest energy at which gravitons can be observed? We address this question by studying graviton-to-photon conversion - the inverse-Gertsenshtein effect - in the magnetic field of the Milky Way. We find that above $\\sim 1~\\mbox{PeV}$ the effective photon mass grows large enough to quench the conversion rate. The induced photon flux is comparable to the sensitivity of LHAASO to a diffuse $γ$-ray background, but only for graviton abundances of order $Ω_{\\text{gw}} h^2_0 \\sim 1$. In the future, owing to a better understanding of $γ$-ray backgrounds, larger effective areas and longer observation times, sub-PeV shimmering gravitons with a realistic abundance of $Ω_{\\text{gw}} h^2_0 \\sim 0.01$ could be detected. We show that this is achieved in a cosmologically-motivated scenario of post-recombination superheavy <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> decay. Therefore, the sub-PeV range might be the ultimate energy frontier at which gravitons can be observed.\n",
      "48        The relation between the total mass contained in the globular clusters of a galaxy and the mass of its <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halo has been found observationally to be nearly linear over five decades of mass. However, the high-mass end of this relation is not well determined from previous data and shows large scatter. We analyze the globular cluster systems (GCSs) of a homogeneous sample of 11 brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) through DOLPHOT photometry of their deep Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images in the F814W filter. We standardize the definition of $M_{GCS}$, the total GCS mass, by using the GC total population within a limiting radius of $0.1 R_{virial}$, while the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span>-<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halo mass $M_h$ is determined from the weak-lensing calibration of $M_h$ versus $M_{bary}$. When these 11 BCGs are added to the previously studied homogeneous catalogue of Virgo member galaxies, a total value for $η= M_{GCS}/M_h$ is found to be $(3.0\\pm1.8_{internal})\\times10^{-5}$, slightly higher than previous estimates but with much reduced uncertainty. Perhaps more importantly, the results suggest that the relation continues to have a near-linear shape at the highest galaxy masses, strongly reinforcing the conclusion that accreted GCs make a major contribution to the GC populations at high galaxy mass.\n",
      "49        We introduce an analytic surface density profile for <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halos that accurately reproduces the structure of simulated halos of mass $M_{\\rm vir} = 10^{7-11}\\ M_\\odot$, making it useful for modeling line-of-sight perturbers in strong gravitational lensing models. The two-parameter function has an analytic deflection potential and is more accurate than the projected Navarro, Frenk &amp; White (NFW) profile commonly adopted at this mass scale for perturbers, especially at the small radii of most relevant for lensing perturbations. Using a characteristic radius, $R_{-1}$, where the log slope of surface density is equal to $-1$, and an associated surface density, $Σ_{-1}$, we can represent the expected lensing signal from line-of-sight halos statistically, for an ensemble of halo orientations, using a distribution of {\\em projected concentration} parameters, $\\mathcal{C}_{\\rm vir} := r_{\\rm vir}/ R_{-1}$. Though an individual halo can have a projected concentration that varies with orientation with respect to the observer, the range of projected concentrations correlates with the usual three-dimensional halo concentration in a way that enables ease of use.\n",
      "50        Axions and axion-like particles (ALPs) are a prominent <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> candidate, drawing motivation in part from the axiverse of string theory. Axion-like particles can also arise as composite degrees of freedom of a <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> sector, for example, as <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> pions in <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> Quantum Chromo-Dynamics. In a <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> Standard Model (SM) wherein all 6 quark flavors are light while the photon is massive, one finds a rich low-energy spectrum of stable and ultralight particles, in the form of neutral and charged <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> scalars, and complex neutral scalars analogous to the SM kaon, with mass splittings determined by the mass and charge of the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> quarks. The model finds a natural portal to the visible sector via kinetic coupling of the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> and visible photons, and consequent millicharges for <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>. The <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> can be a mixture of all these ultralight bosonic degrees of freedom, and exhibit both parity-even and parity-odd interactions, making the theory testable at a wide variety of experiments. In context of <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> QCD with $N_f$ flavors of light quarks, this scenario predicts $N_f^2-1$ ultralight axion-like particles -- effectively an axiverse from <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> QCD. This &#39;$π$-axiverse&#39; is consistent with but makes no recourse to string theory, and is complementary to the conventional string theory axiverse.\n",
      "51        The most luminous quasars at $z &gt; 6$ are suspected to be both highly clustered and reside in the most massive <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halos in the early Universe, making them prime targets to search for galaxy overdensities and/or protoclusters. We search for Lyman-break dropout-selected galaxies using HST WFC3/ACS broadband imaging in the fields of three $6 &lt; z &lt; 7$ quasars, as well as their simultaneously observed coordinated-parallel fields, and constrain their photometric redshifts using EAZY. One field, J0305-3150, shows a volume density 10$\\times$ higher than the blank-field UV luminosity function (UVLF) at M$_{UV} &lt; -20$, with tentative evidence of a 3$σ$ overdensity in its parallel field located 15 cMpc away. Another field, J2054-0005, shows an angular overdensity within 500 ckpc from the quasar but still consistent with UVLF predictions within 3$σ$, while the last field, J2348-3054, shows no enhancement. We discuss methods for reducing uncertainty in overdensity measurements when using photometric selection and show that we can robustly select LBGs consistent with being physically associated with the quasar, corroborated by existing JWST/NIRCam WFSS data in the J0305 field. Even accounting for incompleteness, the overdensities in J0305 and J2054 are higher for brighter galaxies at short angular separations, suggesting preferential enhancement of more massive galaxies in the immediate vicinity of the quasar. Finally, we compare the LBG population with previously-identified [CII] and mm-continuum companions; the LBG overdensities are not accompanied by an enhanced number of dusty galaxies, suggesting that the overdense quasar fields are not in the bursty star-forming phase sometimes seen in high-redshift protoclusters.\n"

      "2        This thesis explores the effects of <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> (DM) on neutron stars (NSs) using the relativistic mean-field (RMF) model. The effects of DM on NS properties, including the mass-radius relation, the moment of inertia, and tidal deformability, are calculated by varying its fraction. The study found that the EOS becomes softer with increasing DM momentum, and the DM has marginal effects on nuclear <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> properties, except for the EOSs and binding energy per particle. The study also calculated the properties of isolated, static, and rotating DM admixed NS and found that the DM has significant effects on both static and rotating NS. We have also observed that a tiny amount of DM can accumulate inside the NS, and more amount of it makes the NS unstable. The study also suggests that the secondary component might be a NS with DM content if the underlying nuclear EOS is sufficiently stiff. The $f$-mode oscillations of the DM admixed hyperon stars are calculated and found that there exist a correlation between canonical $f$-mode frequency and the dimensionless tidal deformability parameter ($Λ_{1.4}$) and we have put a constraint on $f$-mode frequency using GW170817 data. Finally, we have calculated the DM admixed binary NS properties and found that the binary system becomes less deformed and sustains more time in its inspiral phases with the addition of DM. Therefore, we suggest that one can take DM inside the compact objects while modeling the inspiral waveforms for the BNS systems.\n",
      "3        Radiative emissions from electrons and positrons generated by <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> (DM) annihilation or decay are one of the most investigated signals in indirect searches of WIMPs. Ideal targets must have large ratio of DM to baryonic <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>. However, such ``<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span>&#39;&#39; systems have a poorly known level of magnetic turbulence, which determines the residence time of the electrons and positrons and therefore also the strength of the expected signal. This typically leads to significant uncertainties in the derived DM bounds. In a novel approach, we compute the self-confinement of the DM-induced electrons and positrons. Indeed, they themselves generate irregularities in the magnetic field, thus setting a lower limit on the presence of the magnetic turbulence. We specifically apply this approach to dwarf spheroidal galaxies. Finally, by comparing the expected synchrotron emission with radio data from the direction of the Draco galaxy collected at the Giant Metre Radio Telescope, we show that the proposed approach can be used to set robust and competitive bounds on WIMP DM.\n",
      "4        The particle origin of <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> (DM) is still one of the main puzzles in modern physics. One of the most promising search strategy to detect DM at laboratories is through the indirect search of cosmic particles that are produced from DM annihilation in space. In particular, the flux of cosmic positrons has been measured with high precision by the AMS-02 experiment demonstrating that an excess above 10 GeV, with respect to the secondary production, is present. We study in this paper the possible DM origin of the positron excess finding the values of the DM mass $M$ and annihilation cross section $\\langle σv \\rangle$ that are needed to fit high-energy positron data. In particular, we find that for DM annihilating into $b\\bar{b}$ it is required to have $M=43$ TeV and $\\langle σv \\rangle = 10^{-21}$ cm$^3$/s while for $τ^+τ^-$ $M=2$ TeV and $\\langle σv \\rangle = 3\\times 10^{-23}$ cm$^3$/s. If DM produce positrons, they are expected to generate gamma rays from the center of the Milky Way and around dwarf galaxy satellites of the Galaxy. We thus combine the values for the DM mass and annihilation cross section obtained with the fit to AMS-02 positron data with the upper limits derived with the non-detection of $γ$ rays with HESS in the direction of the Galactic center and Fermi-LAT for the combined analysis of dwarf galaxies. The main result of the paper is that only DM annihilating into $μ^+ μ^-$ with a mass around 500 GeV and $\\langle σv \\rangle = 4\\times 10^{-24}$ cm$^3$/s can fit AMS-02 data and be compatible with the upper limits found with $γ$ rays. As for the $τ^+ τ^-$ ($b\\bar{b}$) channel, DM can contribute at most at a few tens $\\%$ (a few \\%) level.\n",

We study a semi-analytical subhalo model for interacting <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> with radiation, based on the extended Press-Schechter formalism and subhalos&#39; tidal evolution prescription. We also test the elastic scattering between DM and neutrinos using observations of Milky-Way satellites from the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">Dark</span> Energy Survey and PanSTARRS1. We conservatively impose strong constraints on the DM-neutrino scattering cross section of $σ_{{\\rm DM}\\text{-}ν,n}\\propto E_ν^n$ $(n=0,2,4)$ at $95\\%$ confidence level (CL), $σ_{{\\rm DM}\\text{-}ν,0}&lt; 10^{-32}\\ {\\rm cm^2}\\ (m_{\\rm DM}/{\\rm GeV})$, $σ_{{\\rm DM}\\text{-}ν,2}&lt; 10^{-43}\\ {\\rm cm^2}\\ (m_{\\rm DM}/{\\rm GeV})(E_ν/E_ν^0)^2$ and $σ_{{\\rm DM}\\text{-}ν,4}&lt; 10^{-54}\\ {\\rm cm^2}\\ (m_{\\rm DM}/{\\rm GeV})(E_ν/E_ν^0)^4$, where $E_ν^0$ is the average momentum of relic cosmic neutrinos today, $E_ν^0 \\simeq 3.15 T_ν^0 \\simeq 6.1\\ {\\rm K}$.

      "6        Numerous observations suggest that there exist undiscovered beyond-the-Standard-Model particles and fields. Because of their unknown nature, these exotic particles and fields could interact with Standard Model particles in many different ways and assume a variety of possible configurations. Here we present an overview of the Global Network of Optical Magnetometers for Exotic physics searches (GNOME), our ongoing experimental program designed to test a wide range of exotic physics scenarios. The GNOME experiment utilizes a worldwide network of shielded atomic magnetometers (and, more recently, comagnetometers) to search for spatially and temporally correlated signals due to torques on atomic spins from exotic fields of astrophysical origin. We survey the temporal characteristics of a variety of possible signals currently under investigation such as those from topological defect <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> (axion-like particle domain walls), axion-like particle stars, solitons of complex-valued scalar fields (Q-balls), stochastic fluctuations of bosonic <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> fields, a solar axion-like particle halo, and bursts of ultralight bosonic fields produced by cataclysmic astrophysical events such as binary black hole mergers.\n",
      "7        Recent observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) are yielding tantalizing hints of an early population of massive, bright galaxies at $z &gt; 10$, with Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) observations indicating significant dust masses in place as early as $z\\sim 7$. To understand the implications of these observations, we use the DELPHI semi-analytic model that jointly tracks the assembly of <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halos and their constituent baryons, including the key processes of dust enrichment. Our model employs only two redshift- and mass-independent free parameters that are tuned against all available galaxy data at $z \\sim 5-9$ before it is used to make predictions up to $z \\sim 20$. Our key results are: (1) the model progressively under-predicts the observed ultraviolet luminosity function (UV LF) at $z &gt; 12$; observations at $z&gt;16$ lie close to, or even above, a &#34;maximal&#34; model where all available gas is turned into stars; (2) UV selection would miss 34% of the star formation rate density at $z \\sim 5$, decreasing to 17% by $z \\sim 10$ for bright galaxies with $\\rm{M_{UV}} &lt; -19$; (3) the dust mass ($M_d$) evolves with the stellar mass ($M_*$) and redshift as $\\log(M_d) = 1.194\\log(M_*) + 0.0975z - 5.433$; (4) the escape fraction of UV photons ($f_{\\rm esc}^{\\rm UV}$) decreases with increasing mass and star formation rate. At $z \\sim 7$, $f_{\\rm esc}^{\\rm UV} \\sim 0.8~(0.1)$ for $M_* \\sim 10^9~ (10^{11}) \\, M_\\odot$ galaxies; (5) the dust temperature increases with stellar mass, ranging between $30-33$ K for $M_* \\sim 10^{9-11}M_\\odot$ galaxies at $z \\sim 7$. Finally, we predict the far infrared (FIR) LF at $z \\sim 5-20$, testable with ALMA observations, and caution that spectroscopic redshifts and dust masses must be pinned down before invoking unphysical extrema in galaxy formation models.\n",

At leading order (LO) the annihilation cross-section is infrared dominated and the connection between the unitarity bound and the upper bound on the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> mass depends only on how the different partial waves are populated. We compute how this picture is modified at next-to-leading order (NLO) with the goal of assigning a reliable theory uncertainty to the freeze-out predictions. We explicitly compute NLO corrections in a simple model with abelian gauge interactions and provide an estimate of the theoretical uncertainty for the thermal masses of heavy electroweak $n$-plets. Along the way, we clarify the regularization and matching procedure necessary to deal with singular potentials in quantum mechanics with a calculable relativistic UV completion.\n",

We consider many nonrelativistic interactions up to quartic order in the Schrödinger field (both short and long-range, and spin-dependent and spin-independent interactions), including explicit spin-orbit couplings. The algorithm allows for spatially varying external and/or self-generated vector potentials that couple to the spin density of the field.

      "10        We discuss the production of primordial black holes in an early <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> dominated era, which typically takes place in string inspired early universe cosmological models. In particular, we consider a pre-big bang scenario (extending previous results regarding formation in the radiation dominated era) where the enhancement of curvature perturbations is induced by a variation of the sound-speed parameter c_s during the string phase of high-curvature inflation. After imposing all relevant observational constraints, we find that the considered class of models is compatible with the production of a large amount of primordial black holes, in the mass range relevant to <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>, only for a small range of the parameters space.

An indication for a non-zero coupling between <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> and neutrinos (both assuming a temperature independent and $T^2$ dependent cross-section) is obtained at the 1$σ$ level coming from the ACT CMB data alone and when combined with the Planck CMB and Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) measurements. This result is confirmed by both fixing the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom in the early Universe to the Standard Model value of $N_{\\rm eff}=3.044$, and allowing $N_{\\rm eff}$ to be a free cosmological parameter. Furthermore, when performing a Bayesian model comparison, the interacting $ν$DM (+$N_{\\rm eff}$) scenario is mostly preferred over a baseline $Λ$CDM (+$N_{\\rm eff}$) cosmology.

The $\\ell$-boson stars are numerical solutions to the non-relativistic limit of the Einstein-Klein-Gordon system, the Schrödinger-Poisson (SP) system.

We perform a bayesian analysis by modifying the SimpleMC code to perform the parameter inference, for the cases with $\\ell = 0$, $\\ell = 1$ and multistates of $\\ell$-boson stars. We used the Akaike information criterion (AIC), Bayesian information criterion and the Bayes factor to compare the excited state ($\\ell$=1) and the multistate case with the ground state ($\\ell$=0) as the base model due to its simplicity. We found that the data in most galaxies in the sample favours the multistates case and that the scalar field mass tends to be slightly bigger than the ground state case.\n",
      "15        A long-standing observed curiosity of globular clusters (GCs) has been that both the number and total mass of GCs in a galaxy are linearly correlated with the galaxy&#39;s virial mass, whereas its stellar component shows no such linear correlation. This work expands on an empirical model for the numbers and ages of GCs in galaxies presented by Valenzuela et al. (2021) that is consistent with recent observational data from massive elliptical galaxies down to the dwarf galaxy regime. Applying the model to simulations, GC numbers are shown to be excellent tracers for the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> (DM) virial mass, even when distinct formation mechanisms are employed for blue and red GCs. Furthermore, the amount of DM smooth accretion is encoded in the GC abundances, therefore providing a measure for an otherwise nearly untraceable component of the formation history of galaxies.\n",
      "16        We analytically solve the problem of Bose star growth in the bath of gravitationally interacting particles. We find that after nucleation of this object, the bath is described by a self-similar solution of the kinetic equation, which is an attractor. Together with the conservation laws, this fixes mass evolution of the Bose star. Our results explain slowdown of the star growth at a certain &#34;core-halo&#34; mass, but also predict formation of the heavier and lighter objects in magistral <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> models.\n",
      "17        <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">Dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> subhaloes are key for the predictions of simulations of structure formation, but their existence frequently ends prematurely due to two technical issues, namely numerical disruption in N-body simulations and halo finders failing to identify them. Here we focus on the second issue, using the phase-space friends-of-friends halo finder ROCKSTAR as a benchmark (though we expect our results to translate to comparable codes). We confirm that the most prominent cause for losing track of subhaloes is tidal distortion rather than a low number of particles. As a solution, we present a flexible post-processing algorithm that tracks all subhalo particles over time, computes subhalo positions and masses based on those particles, and progressively removes stripped <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>. If a subhalo is lost by the halo finder, this algorithm keeps tracking its so-called ghost until it has almost no particles left or has truly merged with its host. We apply this technique to a large suite of N-body simulations and restore lost subhaloes to the halo catalogues, which has a dramatic effect on key summary statistics of large-scale structure. Specifically, the subhalo mass function increases by about 50% and the halo correlation function increases by a factor of two at small scales. While these quantitative results are somewhat specific to our algorithm, they demonstrate that particle tracking is a promising way to reliably follow haloes and reduce the need for orphan models. Our algorithm and augmented halo catalogues are publicly available.\n",
      "18        Ultralight bosons are predicted in many extensions to the Standard Model and are popular <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> candidates. The black hole superradiance mechanism allows for these particles to be probed using only their gravitational interaction. In this scenario, an ultralight boson cloud may form spontaneously around a spinning black hole and extract a non-negligible fraction of the black hole&#39;s mass. These oscillating clouds produce quasi-monochromatic, long-duration gravitational waves that may be detectable by ground-based or space-based gravitational wave detectors. We discuss the capability of a new long-duration signal tracking method, based on a hidden Markov model, to detect gravitational wave signals generated by ultralight vector boson clouds, including cases where the signal frequency evolution timescale is much shorter than that of a typical continuous wave signal. We quantify the detection horizon distances for vector boson clouds with current- and next-generation ground-based detectors. We demonstrate that vector clouds hosted by black holes with mass $\\gtrsim 60 M_{\\odot}$ and spin $\\gtrsim 0.6$ are within the reach of current-generation detectors up to a luminosity distance of $\\sim 1$ Gpc. This search method enables one to target vector boson clouds around remnant black holes from compact binary mergers detected by gravitational-wave detectors. We discuss the impact of the sky localization of the merger events and demonstrate that a typical remnant black hole reasonably well-localized by the current generation detector network is accessible in a follow-up search.\n",
      "19        Lithium-drifted silicon [Si(Li)] has been used for decades as an ionizing radiation detector in nuclear, particle, and astrophysical experiments, though such detectors have frequently been limited to small sizes (few cm$^2$) and cryogenic operating temperatures. The 10-cm-diameter Si(Li) detectors developed for the General Antiparticle Spectrometer (GAPS) balloon-borne <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> experiment are novel particularly for their requirements of low cost, large sensitive area (~10 m$^2$ for the full 1440-detector array), high temperatures (near -40$\\,^\\circ$C), and energy resolution below 4 keV FWHM for 20--100-keV x-rays. Previous works have discussed the manufacturing, passivation, and small-scale testing of prototype GAPS Si(Li) detectors. Here we show for the first time the results from detailed characterization of over 1100 flight detectors, illustrating the consistent intrinsic low-noise performance of a large sample of GAPS detectors. This work demonstrates the feasibility of large-area and low-cost Si(Li) detector arrays for next-generation astrophysics and nuclear physics applications.\n",

The boosted <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">Dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">Matter</span> flux at the edge of the Earth&#39;s atmosphere is expected to be pointing to the Galactic Center, with a flux 15 to 20 times larger than in the transverse direction.\n",
      "21        We investigate the reach of future gravitational wave (GW) detectors in probing inflaton couplings with visible sector particles that can either be bosonic or fermionic in nature. Assuming reheating takes place through perturbative quantum production from vacuum in presence of classical inflaton background field, we find that the spectral energy density of the primordial GW generated during inflation becomes sensitive to inflaton-<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> coupling. We conclude, obeying bounds from Big Bang Nucleosysthesis and Cosmic Microwave Background, that, e.g., inflaton-scalar couplings of the order of $\\sim\\mathcal{O}(10^{-20})$ GeV fall within the sensitivity range of several proposed GW detector facilities. However, this prediction is sensitive to the size of the inflationary scale, nature of the inflaton-<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> interaction and shape of the potential during reheating. Having found the time-dependent effective inflaton decay width, we also discuss its implications for <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> (DM) production from the thermal plasma via UV freeze-in during reheating. It is shown, that one can reproduce the observed DM abundance for its mass up to several PeVs, depending on the dimension of the operator connecting DM with the thermal bath and the associated scale of the UV physics. Thus we promote primordial GW to observables sensitive to feebly coupled inflaton, which is very challenging if not impossible to test in conventional particle physics laboratories or astrophysical measurements.\n",
      "22        We argue that demanding a consistent cosmological history, including the absence of domain walls and strongly interacting relics at the Peccei-Quinn scale, singles out two concrete realizations of hadronic QCD axions as viable <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> models. These realizations generally feature flavor-violating axion couplings to Standard Model quarks that are unsuppressed at low energies. As a consequence, experiments looking for flavor-violating hadronic processes involving the axion can be sensitive probes of QCD axion <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> models. In particular, we show that the NA62 and KOTO experiments could detect the $K\\rightarrowπ+ a$ decay for axions consistent with the observed <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> abundance via the post-inflationary misalignment mechanism.\n",
      "23        The mean <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> density within the turnaround radius, which is the boundary that separates a nonexpanding structure from the Hubble flow, was recently proposed as a novel cosmological probe. According to the spherical collapse model, the evolution with cosmic time of this turnaround density, $\\rm ρ_{ta}(z)$, can be used to determine both $\\rm Ω_m$ and $Ω_Λ$, independently of any other currently used probe. The properties of $\\rm ρ_{ta}$ predicted by the spherical collapse model were also shown to persist in the presence of full three-dimensional effects in $\\rm Λ$CDM N-body cosmological simulations when considering galaxy clusters at the present time, $z=0$. However, a small offset was discovered between the spherical-collapse prediction of the value of $ρ_{ta}$ at $z=0$ and its value measured in simulations. In this letter, we explore whether this offset evolves with cosmic time; whether it differs in different cosmologies; whether its origin can be confidently identified; and whether it can be corrected. We found that the offset does evolve slightly with redshift, and that it correlates strongly with the deviation from spherical symmetry of the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halo distribution inside and outside of the turnaround radius. We used an appropriate metric to quantify deviations in the environment of a structure from spherical symmetry. We found that using this metric, we can construct a sphericity-selected sample of halos for which the offset of $ρ_{ta}$ from the spherical collapse prediction is zero, independently of redshift and cosmology. We found that a sphericity-selected halo sample allows us to recover the simulated cosmology, and we conclude that the turnaround density evolution indeed encodes the cosmology in N-body simulations.\n",
      "24        We present a new suite of over 1,500 cosmological N-body simulations with varied Warm <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">Dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">Matter</span> (WDM) models ranging from 2.5 to 30 keV. We use these simulations to train Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to infer WDM particle masses from images of DM field data. Our fiducial setup can make accurate predictions of the WDM particle mass up to 7.5 keV at a 95% confidence level from small maps that cover an area of (25 h$^{-1}$ Mpc)$^2$. We vary the image resolution, simulation resolution, redshift, and cosmology of our fiducial setup to better understand how our model is making predictions. Using these variations, we find that our models are most dependent on simulation resolution, minimally dependent on image resolution, not systematically dependent on redshift, and robust to varied cosmologies. We also find that an important feature to distinguish between WDM models is present with a linear size between 100 and 200 h$^{-1}$ kpc. We compare our fiducial model to one trained on the power spectrum alone and find that our field-level model can make 2x more precise predictions and can make accurate predictions to 2x as massive WDM particle masses when used on the same data. Overall, we find that the field-level data can be used to accurately differentiate between WDM models and contain more information than is captured by the power spectrum. This technique can be extended to more complex DM models and opens up new opportunities to explore alternative DM models in a cosmological environment.\n",
      "25        The properties of globular clusters (GCs) contain valuable information of their host galaxies and <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span>-<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halos. In the remarkable example of ultra-diffuse galaxy, NGC5846-UDG1, the GC population exhibits strong radial mass segregation, indicative of dynamical-friction-driven orbital decay, which opens the possibility of using imaging data alone to constrain the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span>-<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> content of the galaxy. To explore this possibility, we develop a semi-analytical model of GC evolution, which starts from the initial mass function, the initial structure-mass relation, and the initial spatial distribution of the GC progenitors, and follows the effects of dynamical friction, tidal evolution, and two-body relaxation. Using Markov Chain Monte Carlo, we forward-model the GCs in a NGC5846-UDG1-like potential to match the observed GC mass, size, and spatial distributions, and to constrain the profile of the host halo and the origin of the GCs. We find that, with the assumptions of zero mass segregation when the star clusters were born, NGC5846-UDG1 is <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span>-<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> poor compared to what is expected from stellar-to-halo-mass relations, and its halo concentration is low, irrespective of having a cuspy or a cored halo profile. Its GC population has an initial spatial distribution more extended than the smooth stellar distribution. We discuss the results in the context of scaling laws of galaxy-halo connections, and warn against naively using the GC-abundance-halo-mass relation to infer the halo mass of UDGs. Our model is generally applicable to GC-rich dwarf galaxies, and is publicly available at https://github.com/JiangFangzhou/GCevo.\n",
      "26        The Epoch of Reionization (EoR) neutral Hydrogen (HI) 21-cm signal evolves significantly along the line-of-sight (LoS) due to the light-cone (LC) effect. It is important to accurately incorporate this in simulations in order to correctly interpret the signal. 21-cm LC simulations are typically produced by stitching together slices from a finite number $(N_{\\rm RS})$ of &#39;&#39;reionization snapshot&#39;&#39;, each corresponding to a different stage of reionization. In this paper, we have quantified the errors in the 21-cm LC simulation due to the finite value of $N_{\\rm RS}$. We show that this can introduce large discontinuities $(&gt; 200 \\%)$ at the stitching boundaries when $N_{\\rm RS}$ is small $(= 2,4)$ and the mean neutral fraction jumps by $δ\\bar{x}_{\\rm HI} = 0.2,0.1$ respectively at the stitching boundaries. This drops to $17 \\%$ for $N_{\\rm RS} = 13$ where $δ\\bar{x}_{\\rm HI}=0.02$. We present and also validate a method for mitigating this error by increasing $N_{\\rm RS}$ without a proportional increase in the computational costs which are mainly incurred in generating the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> and halo density fields. Our method generates these fields only at a few redshifts, and interpolates them to generate reionization snapshots at closely spaced redshifts. We use this to generate 21-cm LC simulations with $N_{\\rm RS} = 26,51,101$ and $201$, and show that the errors go down as $N_{\\rm RS}^{-1}$.\n",
      "27        The advent of gravitational wave astronomy has seen a huge influx of new predictions for potential discoveries of beyond the Standard Model fields. The coupling of all fundamental fields to gravity, together with its dominance on large scales, makes gravitational physics a rich laboratory to study fundamental physics. This holds especially true for the search for the elusive <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> photon, a promising <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> candidate. The <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> photon is predicted to generate instabilities in a rotating black hole spacetime, birthing a macroscopic Bose-Einstein condensate. These condensates can especially form around super massive black holes, modifying the dynamical inspiralling process. This then opens another window to leverage future space-borne gravitational wave antennas to join the hunt for the elusive <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> particle. This study builds a preliminary model for the gravitational waveform emitted by such a dressed extreme mass-ratio inspiral. Comparing these waveforms to the vacuum scenario allows projections to the potential constrainability on the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> photon mass by space-borne gravitational wave antennas. The superradiant instability of a massive vector field on a Kerr background is calculated and the modification to the dynamics of an inspiralling solar mass-scale compact object is determined with approximations on the backreaction effect of the cloud on the compact object. The end result is the projection that the LISA mission should be able to constrain the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> photon mass using extreme mass ratio inspirals in the range $[1.8 \\times 10^{-17}, 4.47 \\times 10^{-16}]$ eV.\n",
      "28        Recent observations made by the JWST have revealed a number of massive galaxies at high redshift ($z$). The presence of these galaxies appears at odds with the current $Λ$CDM cosmology. Here we investigate the possibility of alleviating the tension by incorporating uncertainties from three sources in counting massive galaxies at high $z$: cosmic variance, error in stellar mass estimate, and contribution by backsplash. We find that each of the sources can significantly increase the cumulative stellar mass density $ρ_*(&gt;M_*)$ at the high-mass end, and the combination of them can boost the density by more than one order of magnitude. Assuming a star formation efficiency of $ε_* \\sim 0.5$, cosmic variance alone can reduce the tension to $2σ$ level, except the most massive galaxy at $z=8$. Including in addition a lognormal dispersion with a width of 0.3 dex in the stellar mass can bring the observed stellar mass density at $z \\sim 7 - 10$ to the $2σ$ range of the cosmic variance. The tension is completely eliminated when gas stripped from backsplash halos is also taken into account. Our results highlight the importance of fully modeling uncertainties when interpreting observational data of rare objects. We use the constrained simulation, ELUCID, to investigate the descendants of high $z$ massive galaxies. We find that a significant portion of these galaxies end up in massive halos with mass $M_{\\rm halo} &gt; 10^{13} h^{-1}M_\\odot $ at $z=0$. A large fraction of central galaxies in $M_{\\rm halo} \\geqslant 10^{14.5} h^{-1}M_\\odot$ halos today are predicted to contain significant amounts of ancient stars formed in massive galaxies at $z\\sim 8$. This prediction can be tested by studying the structure and stellar population of central galaxies in present-day massive clusters.\n",
      "29        Within the $Λ$CDM cosmology, <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> haloes are comprised of both a smooth component and a population of smaller, gravitationally bound subhaloes. These components are often treated as a single halo when halo properties, such as density profiles, are extracted from simulations. Recent work has shown that density profiles change substantially when subhalo mass is excluded. In this paper, we expand on this result by analysing the change in three specific host halo properties -- concentration ($c_{\\rm{NFW}}$), spin ($λ_{\\rm Bullock}$), and shape ($c/a$), -- when calculated only from the smooth component of the halo. This analysis is performed on both Milky Way-mass haloes and cluster-mass haloes in high-resolution, zoom-in, $N$-body simulations. We find that when subhaloes are excluded the median value of (1) $c_{\\rm{NFW}}$ is enhanced by $\\approx 38 \\pm 12\\%$ and $\\approx 88 \\pm 7.7\\%$ for Milky Way mass ($10^{12.1}\\,\\text{M}_\\odot$) and cluster mass ($10^{14.8}\\,\\text{M}_\\odot$) haloes respectively, (2) $λ_{\\rm Bullock}$ is reduced for Milky Way mass by $\\approx 16 \\pm 6.8\\%$ and cluster mass haloes by $\\approx 32 \\pm 8.9\\%$. Additionally, with the removal of subhaloes, cluster mass haloes tend to become more spherical as the ratio of minor-to-major axis, $c/a$, increases by $\\approx 12 \\pm 4\\%$, whereas Milky Way mass haloes remain approximately the same shape with $c/a$ changed by $\\approx 1.2 \\pm 5.6\\%$. The fractional change of each of these properties depends primarily on the amount of mass that is removed from the halo system and, to a lesser extent, mass accretion history. Our findings demonstrate that the properties of the smooth components of <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> haloes are biased relative to the total mass of the halo including subhaloes.\n",
      "30        In order to test active galactic nucleus (AGN) unification and evolutionary models, we measured the AGN clustering properties as a function of AGN obscuration defined in terms of hydrogen column density, $N_{\\rm H}$. In addition to measuring the clustering of unobscured ($N_{\\rm H} &lt; 10^{22}\\,{\\rm cm}^{-2}$) and moderately obscured ($10^{22} \\leq N_{\\rm H} &lt; 10^{23.5}$) AGNs, we also targeted highly obscured sources ($N_{\\rm H}\\geq 10^{23.5}$) up to redshifts of $z=3$. We have compiled one of the largest samples of X-ray-selected AGNs from a total of eight deep XMM/Chandra surveys. We measured the clustering as a function of both AGN obscuration and redshift using the projected two-point correlation function, $w_{\\rm p}(r_{\\rm p})$. We modeled the large-scale clustering signal, measured the AGN bias, $b(z, N_{\\rm H})$, and interpreted it in terms of the typical AGN host <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halo, $M_{\\rm halo}(z, N_{\\rm H}$). We find no significant dependence of AGN clustering on obscuration, suggesting similar typical masses of the hosting halos as a function of $N_{\\rm H}$. This result matches expectations of AGN unification models, in which AGN obscuration depends mainly on the viewing angle of the obscuring torus. We measured, for the first time, the clustering of highly obscured AGNs and find that these objects reside in halos with typical mass $\\log M_{\\rm halo} = 12.98_{-0.22}^{+0.17} [h^{-1} M_\\odot]$ ($12.28_{-0.19}^{+0.13}$) at low $z \\sim 0.7$ (high $z \\sim 1.8$) redshifts. We find that irrespective of obscuration, an increase in AGN bias with redshift is slower than the expectation for a constant halo mass and instead follows the growth rate of halos, known as the passive evolution track. This implies that for those AGNs the clustering is mainly driven by the mass growth rate of the hosting halos and galaxies across cosmic time.\n",
      "31        Mergers between galaxy clusters are an important stage in the formation of the large-scale structure of the Universe. Some of the mergers show a spectacular bow shock that formed as a result of recent passage of a smaller cluster through a bigger one, the classic example of this being the so-called bullet cluster. In this paper, I describe ten examples of interacting clusters identified among 200 of the most massive objects, with total masses above $1.4 \\times 10^{14}$ M$_{\\odot}$, from the IllustrisTNG300 simulation by searching for prominent bow shocks in their temperature maps. Despite different mass ratios of the two merging clusters, the events are remarkably similar in many respects. In all cases, the companion cluster passed close to the main one only once, between 0.9 and 0.3 Gyr ago, with the pericenter distance of 100-530 kpc and a velocity of up to 3400 km s$^{-1}$. The subcluster, typically an order of magnitude smaller in mass than the main cluster before the interaction, loses most of its <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> and gas in the process. The displacement between the collisionless part of the remnant and the bow shock is such that the remnant typically lags behind the shock or coincides with it, with a single exception of the merger occurring with the largest velocity. Usually about 1% of the gas cells in the merging clusters are shocked, and the median Mach numbers of these gas cells are around two. Due to the relatively small size of the simulation box, no close analog of the bullet cluster was found, but I identified one case that is similar in terms of mass, velocity, and displacement. The presented cases bear more resemblance to less extreme observed interacting clusters such as A520 and Coma.\n",
      "32        Microscopic horizonless relics could form in the early universe either directly through gravitational collapse or as stable remnants of the Hawking evaporation of primordial black holes. In both cases they completely or partially evade cosmological constraints arising from Hawking evaporation and in certain mass ranges can explain the entirety of the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>. We systematically explore the stochastic gravitational-wave background associated with the formation of microscopic <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span>-<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> relics in various scenarios, adopting an agnostic approach and discussing the limitations introduced by existing constraints, possible ways to circumvent the latter, and expected astrophysical foregrounds.

      "33        In direct <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> (DM) detection via scattering off the electrons, the momentum transfer plays a crucial role. Previous work showed that for self-interacting DM, if the DM particle has a size (the so-called puffy DM), the radius effect could dominate the momentum transfer and become another source of velocity dependence for self-scattering cross section. In this work we investigate the direct detection of puffy DM particles with different radii through electron recoil. We find that comparing with the available experimental exclusion limits dominated by the mediator effect for XENON10, XENON100 and XENON1T, the constraints on the puffy DM-electron scattering cross-section become much weaker for large radius DM particles. For small-radius DM particles, the constraints remain similar to the point-like DM case.\n",
      "34        Boson stars are gravitationally bound objects that arise in ultralight <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> models and form in the centers of galactic halos or axion miniclusters. We systematically study the excitations of a boson star, taking into account the mixing between positive and negative frequencies introduced by gravity. We show that the spectrum contains zero-energy modes in the monopole and dipole sectors resulting from spontaneous symmetry breaking by the boson star background. We analyze the general properties of the eigenmodes and derive their orthogonality and completeness conditions which have non-standard form due to the positive-negative frequency mixing. The eigenvalue problem is solved numerically for the first few energy levels in different multipole sectors and the results are compared to the solutions of the Schrödinger equation in fixed boson star gravitational potential. The two solutions differ significantly for the lowest modes, but get close for higher levels. We further confirm the normal mode spectrum in 3D wave simulations where we inject perturbations with different multipoles. As an application of the normal mode solutions, we compute the matrix element entering the evaporation rate of a boson star immersed in a hot axion gas. The computation combines the use of exact wavefunctions for the low-lying bound states and of the Schrödinger approximation for the high-energy excitations.\n",
      "35        If long-range attractive forces exist and are stronger than gravity then cosmic halo formation can begin in the radiation-dominated era. We study a simple realization of this effect in a system where <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> fermions have Yukawa interactions mediated by scalar particles, analogous to the Higgs boson in the standard model. We develop a self-consistent description of the system including exact background dynamics of the scalar field, and precise modelling of the fermion density fluctuations. For the latter, we provide accurate approximations for the linear growth as well as quantitative modelling of the nonlinear evolution using N-body simulations. We find that halo formation occurs exponentially fast and on scales substantially larger than simple estimates predict. The final fate of these halos remains uncertain, but could be annihilation, <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> stars, primordial black holes, or even the existence of galaxy-sized halos at <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>-radiation equality. More generally, our results demonstrate the importance of mapping scalar-mediated interactions onto structure formation outcomes and constraints for beyond the standard model theories.\n",
      "36        Recent analysis on the stellar kinematics of ultra-faint dwarf (UFD) galaxies has put a stringent upper limit on the self-scattering cross section of <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>, i.e., $σ/m&lt;{\\cal O}(0.1)\\,{\\rm cm^2/g}$ at the scattering velocity of ${\\cal O}(10)\\,{\\rm km/s}$. Resonant self-interacting <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> (rSIDM) is one possibility that can be consistent with the UFDs and explain the low central densities of rotation-supported galaxies; the cross section is resonantly enhanced to be $σ/m = {\\cal O}(1)\\,{\\rm cm^2/g}$ around the scattering velocity of ${\\cal O}(100)\\,{\\rm km/s}$ while being suppressed at lower velocities. To further assess this possibility, since the inferred <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> distribution of halos from astrophysical observations is usually compared to that in constant-cross section SIDM (cSIDM), whether the structures of rSIDM halos can be approximated by the cSIDM halo profiles needs to be clarified. In this work, we employ the grovothermal fluid method to investigate the structural evolution of rSIDM halos in a wide mass range. We find that except for halos in a specific mass range, the present structures of rSIDM halos are virtually indistinguishable from those of the cSIDM halos. For halos in the specific mass range, the resonant self-scattering renders a break in their density profile. We demonstrate how such a density-profile break appears in astrophysical observations, e.g., rotation curves and line-of-sight velocity dispersion profiles. We show that for halos above the specific mass range, the density-profile break thermalizes to disappear before the present. We demonstrate that such distinctive thermalization dynamics can leave imprints on the orbital classes of stars with similar ages and metallicities.\n",
      "37        The E-type $α$-attractor models of single-field inflation were generalized further in order to accommodate production of primordial black holes (PBH) via adding a near-inflection point to the inflaton scalar potential at smaller scales, in good agreement with measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation. A minimal number of new parameters was used but their fine-tuning was maximized in order to increase possible masses of PBH formed during an ultra-slow-roll phase leading to a large enhancement of the power spectrum of scalar (curvature) perturbations by 6 or 7 orders of magnitude against the power spectrum of perturbations observed in CMB. It was found that extreme fine-tuning of the parameters in our models can lead to a formation of the Earth-size PBH with the masses of approximately $10^{27}$ g, still in agreement with CMB observations. Quantum corrections are known to lead to the perturbative upper bound on the amplitude of large scalar perturbations responsible for PBH production. The quantum (one-loop) corrections in our models were found to be suppressed by one order of magnitude for PBH with the masses of approximately $10^{19}$ g, which may form the whole <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> in the Universe.\n",
      "38        We discuss in detail the possibility that the &#34;type-II majoron&#34; -- that is, the pseudo Nambu-Goldstone boson that arises in the context of the type-II seesaw mechanism if the lepton number is spontaneously broken by an additional singlet scalar -- account for the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> (DM) observed in the universe. We study the requirements the model&#39;s parameters have to fulfill in order to reproduce the measured DM relic abundance through two possible production mechanisms in the early universe, freeze-in and misalignment, both during a standard radiation-dominated era and early <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> domination. We then study possible signals of type-II majoron DM and the present and expected constraints on the parameter space that can be obtained from cosmological observations, direct detection experiments, and present and future searches for decaying DM at neutrino telescopes and cosmic-ray experiments. We find that -- depending on the majoron mass, the production mechanism, and the value of the vacuum expectation value of the type-II triplet -- all of the three decay modes (photons, electrons, neutrinos) of majoron DM particles can yield observable signals at future indirect searches for DM. Furthermore, in a corner of the parameter space, detection of majoron DM is possible through electron recoil at running and future direct detection experiments.\n",
      "39        Running vacuum models and viscous <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> scenarios beyond perfect fluid idealization are two appealing theoretical strategies that have been separately studied as alternatives to solve some problems rooted in the $Λ$CDM cosmological model. In this paper, we combine these two notions in a single cosmological setting and investigate their cosmological implications, paying particular attention in the interplay between these two constituents in different cosmological periods. Specifically, we consider a well-studied running vacuum model inspired by renormalization group, and a recently proposed general parameterization for the bulk viscosity $ξ$. By employing dynamical system analysis, we explore the physical aspects of the new phase space that emerges from the combined models and derive stability conditions that ensure complete cosmological dynamics. We identify four distinct classes of models and find that the critical points of the phase space are non-trivially renewed compared to the single scenarios. We then proceed, in a joint and complementary way to the dynamical system analysis, with a detailed numerical exploration to quantify the impact of both the running parameter and the bulk viscosity coefficient on the cosmological evolution. Thus, for some values of the model parameters, numerical solutions show qualitative differences from the $Λ$CDM model, which is phenomenologically appealing in light of cosmological observations.\n",
      "40        The intrinsic alignment (IA) of observed galaxy shapes with the underlying cosmic web is a source of contamination in weak lensing surveys. Sensitive methods to identify the IA signal will therefore need to be included in the upcoming weak lensing analysis pipelines. Hydrodynamical cosmological simulations allow us to directly measure the intrinsic ellipticities of galaxies and thus provide a powerful approach to predict and understand the IA signal. Here we employ the novel, large-volume hydrodynamical simulation MTNG740, a product of the MillenniumTNG (MTNG) project, to study the IA of galaxies. We measure the projected correlation functions between the intrinsic shape/shear of galaxies and various tracers of large-scale structure, $w_{+g},\\ w_{+m},\\ w_{++}$ over the radial range $r_{\\rm p} \\in [0.02 , 200]\\,h^{-1}{\\rm Mpc}$ and at redshifts $z=0.0$, $0.5$ and $1.0$. We detect significant signal-to-noise IA signals with the density field for both elliptical and spiral galaxies. We also find significant intrinsic shear-shear correlations for ellipticals. We further examine correlations of the intrinsic shape of galaxies with the local tidal field. Here we find a significant IA signal for elliptical galaxies assuming a linear model. We also detect a weak IA signal for spiral galaxies under a quadratic tidal torquing model. Lastly, we measure the alignment between central galaxies and their host <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span>-<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halos, finding small to moderate misalignments between their principal axes that decline with halo mass.\n",
      "41        We study weak gravitational lensing convergence maps produced from the MillenniumTNG (MTNG) simulations by direct projection of the mass distribution on the past backwards lightcone of a fiducial observer. We explore the lensing maps over a large dynamic range in simulation mass and angular resolution, allowing us to establish a clear assessment of numerical convergence. By comparing full physics hydrodynamical simulations with corresponding <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span>-<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>-only runs we quantify the impact of baryonic physics on the most important weak lensing statistics. Likewise, we predict the impact of massive neutrinos reliably far into the non-linear regime. We also demonstrate that the &#34;fixed &amp; paired&#34; variance suppression technique increases the statistical robustness of the simulation predictions on large scales not only for time slices but also for continuously output lightcone data. We find that both baryonic and neutrino effects substantially impact weak lensing shear measurements, with the latter dominating over the former on large angular scales. Thus, both effects must explicitly be included to obtain sufficiently accurate predictions for stage IV lensing surveys. Reassuringly, our results agree accurately with other simulation results where available, supporting the promise of simulation modelling for precision cosmology far into the non-linear regime.\n",
      "42        An era of kination occurs when the Universe&#39;s energy density is dominated by a fast-rolling scalar field. <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">Dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> that is thermally produced during an era of kination requires larger-than-canonical annihilation cross sections to generate the observed <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> relic abundance. Furthermore, <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> density perturbations that enter the horizon during an era of kination grow linearly with the scale factor prior to radiation domination. We show how the resulting enhancement to the small-scale <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> power spectrum increases the microhalo abundance and boosts the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> annihilation rate. We then use gamma-ray observations to constrain thermal <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> production during kination. The annihilation boost factor depends on the minimum halo mass, which is determined by the small-scale cutoff in the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> power spectrum. Therefore, observational limits on the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> annihilation rate imply a minimum cutoff scale for a given <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> particle mass and kination scenario. For <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> that was once in thermal equilibrium with the Standard Model, this constraint establishes a maximum allowed kinetic decoupling temperature for the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>. This bound on the decoupling temperature implies that the growth of perturbations during kination cannot appreciably boost the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> annihilation rate if <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> was once in thermal equilibrium with the Standard Model.\n",
      "43        We present the measurement of total and stellar/<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> decomposed mass density profile around a sample of galaxy groups and clusters with dynamical masses derived from integral-field stellar kinematics from the MaNGA survey in Paper~I and weak lensing derived from the DECaLS imaging survey. Combining the two data sets enables accurate measurement of the radial density distribution from several kpc to Mpc scales. Intriguingly, we find that the excess surface density derived from stellar kinematics in the inner region cannot be explained by simply adding an NFW <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halo extrapolated from lensing measurement at a larger scale to a stellar mass component derived from the NASA-Sloan Atlas (NSA) catalog. We find that a good fit to both data sets requires a stellar mass normalization about 3 times higher than that derived from the NSA catalog, which would require an unrealistically too-heavy initial mass function for stellar mass estimation. If we keep the stellar mass normalization to that of the NSA catalog but allow a varying inner <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> density profile, we obtain an asymptotic slope of $γ_{\\rm gnfw}$= $1.82_{-0.25}^{+0.15}$, $γ_{\\rm gnfw}$= $1.48_{-0.41}^{+0.20}$ for the group bin and the cluster bin respectively, significantly steeper than the NFW case. We also compare the total mass inner density slopes with those from Illustris-TNG300 and find that the values from the simulation are lower than the observation by at least $3σ$ level.\n",
      "44        We present dynamical scaling relations, combined with the stellar population properties, for a subsample of about 6000 nearby galaxies with the most reliable dynamical models extracted from the full MaNGA sample of 10K galaxies. We show that the inclination-corrected mass plane (MP) for both early-type galaxies (ETGs) and late-type galaxies (LTGs), which links dynamical mass, projected half-light radius $R_{\\rm e}$, and the second stellar velocity moment $σ_{\\rm e}$ within $R_{\\rm e}$, satisfies the virial theorem and is even tighter than the uncorrected one. We find a clear parabolic relation between $\\lg(M/L)(&lt;R_{\\rm e})$, the total mass-to-light ratio within a sphere of radius $R_{\\rm e}$, and $\\lgσ_{\\rm e}$, with the $M/L$ increasing with $σ_{\\rm e}$ and for older stellar populations. However, the relation for ETGs is linear and the one for the youngest galaxies is constant. We confirm and improve the relation between average logarithmic total density slopes $γ_{_{\\rm T}}$ and $σ_{\\rm e}$: $γ_{_{\\rm T}}$ become steeper with increasing $σ_{\\rm e}$ until $\\lg(σ_{\\rm e}/{\\rm km\\,s^{-1}})\\approx 2.2$ and then remain constant around $γ_{_{\\rm T}}\\approx -2.2$. The $γ_{_{\\rm T}}-σ_{\\rm e}$ variation is larger for LTGs than ETGs. At fixed $σ_{\\rm e}$ the total density profiles steepen with galaxy age and for ETGs. We find generally low <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> fractions, median $f_{\\rm DM}(&lt;R_{\\rm e})=8$ per cent, within a sphere of radius $R_{\\rm e}$. However, we find that $f_{\\rm DM}(&lt;R_{\\rm e})$ depends on $σ_{\\rm e}$ better than stellar mass: <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> increases to a median $f_{\\rm DM}=33$ percent for galaxies with $σ_{\\rm e}\\lesssim100{\\rm km\\,s^{-1}}$. The increased $f_{\\rm DM}(&lt;R_{\\rm e})$ at low $σ_{\\rm e}$ explains the parabolic $\\lg(M/L)(&lt;R_{\\rm e})-\\lgσ_{\\rm e}$ relation.\n",
      "45        We analyze the global stellar population, radial gradients and non-parametric star formation history of $\\sim 10$K galaxies from the MaNGA Survey final data release 17 (DR17), based on stellar population synthesis and full-spectrum fitting, and relate them with dynamical properties of galaxies. We confirm that stellar population correlates with stellar velocity dispersion $σ_{\\rm e}$ better than with stellar mass $M_{\\ast}$, but also find that younger galaxies are more metal-poor at fixed $σ_{\\rm e}$. Stellar age, metallicity, and mass-to-light ratio $M_{\\ast}/L$ all decrease with galaxy rotation, while radial gradients become more negative (i.e., younger, more metal-poor, and lower $M_{\\ast}/L$ in the outskirts). The trend between metallicity gradients and rotation reverses for slow rotators, which stand out for their more negative metallicity gradients than faster-rotating galaxies. We highlight a population of massive disk galaxies on the green valley, on the $(σ_{\\rm e},\\rm Age)$ plane, that show steep negative age and metallicity gradients, consistent with their old central bulges surrounded by young star-forming disks and metal-poor gas accretion. Galaxies with high $σ_{\\rm e}$, steep total mass-density slope, low <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> fraction, high $M_{\\ast}/L$, and high metallicity have the highest star-formation rate at earlier times, and are currently quenched. We discover a population of low-mass star-forming galaxies with low rotation but physically distinct from the massive slow rotators. A catalogue of the population properties is provided publicly.\n",
      "46        This is the first paper in our series on the combined analysis of the Dynamics and stellar Population (DynPop) for the MaNGA survey in the final SDSS Data Release 17 (DR17). Here we present a catalogue of dynamically-determined quantities for over 10000 nearby galaxies based on integral-field stellar kinematics from the MaNGA survey. The dynamical properties are extracted using the axisymmetric Jeans Anisotropic Modelling (JAM) method, which was previously shown to be the most accurate for this kind of study. We assess systematic uncertainties using eight dynamical models with different assumptions. We use two orientations of the velocity ellipsoid: either cylindrically-aligned JAM$_{\\rm cyl}$ or spherically-aligned JAM$_{\\rm sph}$. We also make four assumptions for the models&#39; <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> vs. luminous <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> distributions: (1) mass-follows-light, (2) free NFW <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> halo, (3) cosmologically-constrained NFW halo, (4) generalized NFW <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> halo, i.e. with free inner slope. In this catalogue, we provide the quantities related to the mass distributions (e.g. the density slopes and enclosed mass within a sphere of a given radius for total mass, stellar mass, and <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> mass components). We also provide the complete models which can be used to compute the full luminous and mass distribution of each galaxy. Additionally, we visually assess the qualities of the models to help with model selections. We estimate the observed scatter in the measured quantities which decreases as expected with improvements in quality. For the best data quality, we find a remarkable consistency of measured quantities between different models, highlighting the robustness of the results.\n",
      "47        What is the highest energy at which gravitons can be observed? We address this question by studying graviton-to-photon conversion - the inverse-Gertsenshtein effect - in the magnetic field of the Milky Way. We find that above $\\sim 1~\\mbox{PeV}$ the effective photon mass grows large enough to quench the conversion rate. The induced photon flux is comparable to the sensitivity of LHAASO to a diffuse $γ$-ray background, but only for graviton abundances of order $Ω_{\\text{gw}} h^2_0 \\sim 1$. In the future, owing to a better understanding of $γ$-ray backgrounds, larger effective areas and longer observation times, sub-PeV shimmering gravitons with a realistic abundance of $Ω_{\\text{gw}} h^2_0 \\sim 0.01$ could be detected. We show that this is achieved in a cosmologically-motivated scenario of post-recombination superheavy <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> decay. Therefore, the sub-PeV range might be the ultimate energy frontier at which gravitons can be observed.\n",
      "48        The relation between the total mass contained in the globular clusters of a galaxy and the mass of its <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halo has been found observationally to be nearly linear over five decades of mass. However, the high-mass end of this relation is not well determined from previous data and shows large scatter. We analyze the globular cluster systems (GCSs) of a homogeneous sample of 11 brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) through DOLPHOT photometry of their deep Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images in the F814W filter. We standardize the definition of $M_{GCS}$, the total GCS mass, by using the GC total population within a limiting radius of $0.1 R_{virial}$, while the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span>-<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halo mass $M_h$ is determined from the weak-lensing calibration of $M_h$ versus $M_{bary}$. When these 11 BCGs are added to the previously studied homogeneous catalogue of Virgo member galaxies, a total value for $η= M_{GCS}/M_h$ is found to be $(3.0\\pm1.8_{internal})\\times10^{-5}$, slightly higher than previous estimates but with much reduced uncertainty. Perhaps more importantly, the results suggest that the relation continues to have a near-linear shape at the highest galaxy masses, strongly reinforcing the conclusion that accreted GCs make a major contribution to the GC populations at high galaxy mass.\n",
      "49        We introduce an analytic surface density profile for <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halos that accurately reproduces the structure of simulated halos of mass $M_{\\rm vir} = 10^{7-11}\\ M_\\odot$, making it useful for modeling line-of-sight perturbers in strong gravitational lensing models. The two-parameter function has an analytic deflection potential and is more accurate than the projected Navarro, Frenk &amp; White (NFW) profile commonly adopted at this mass scale for perturbers, especially at the small radii of most relevant for lensing perturbations. Using a characteristic radius, $R_{-1}$, where the log slope of surface density is equal to $-1$, and an associated surface density, $Σ_{-1}$, we can represent the expected lensing signal from line-of-sight halos statistically, for an ensemble of halo orientations, using a distribution of {\\em projected concentration} parameters, $\\mathcal{C}_{\\rm vir} := r_{\\rm vir}/ R_{-1}$. Though an individual halo can have a projected concentration that varies with orientation with respect to the observer, the range of projected concentrations correlates with the usual three-dimensional halo concentration in a way that enables ease of use.\n",
      "50        Axions and axion-like particles (ALPs) are a prominent <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> candidate, drawing motivation in part from the axiverse of string theory.

In a <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> Standard Model (SM) wherein all 6 quark flavors are light while the photon is massive, one finds a rich low-energy spectrum of stable and ultralight particles, in the form of neutral and charged <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> scalars, and complex neutral scalars analogous to the SM kaon, with mass splittings determined by the mass and charge of the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> quarks.

      "51        The most luminous quasars at $z &gt; 6$ are suspected to be both highly clustered and reside in the most massive <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halos in the early Universe, making them prime targets to search for galaxy overdensities and/or protoclusters. We search for Lyman-break dropout-selected galaxies using HST WFC3/ACS broadband imaging in the fields of three $6 &lt; z &lt; 7$ quasars, as well as their simultaneously observed coordinated-parallel fields, and constrain their photometric redshifts using EAZY. One field, J0305-3150, shows a volume density 10$\\times$ higher than the blank-field UV luminosity function (UVLF) at M$_{UV} &lt; -20$, with tentative evidence of a 3$σ$ overdensity in its parallel field located 15 cMpc away. Another field, J2054-0005, shows an angular overdensity within 500 ckpc from the quasar but still consistent with UVLF predictions within 3$σ$, while the last field, J2348-3054, shows no enhancement. We discuss methods for reducing uncertainty in overdensity measurements when using photometric selection and show that we can robustly select LBGs consistent with being physically associated with the quasar, corroborated by existing JWST/NIRCam WFSS data in the J0305 field. Even accounting for incompleteness, the overdensities in J0305 and J2054 are higher for brighter galaxies at short angular separations, suggesting preferential enhancement of more massive galaxies in the immediate vicinity of the quasar. Finally, we compare the LBG population with previously-identified [CII] and mm-continuum companions; the LBG overdensities are not accompanied by an enhanced number of dusty galaxies, suggesting that the overdense quasar fields are not in the bursty star-forming phase sometimes seen in high-redshift protoclusters.\n"

The effects of DM on NS properties, including the mass-radius relation, the moment of inertia, and tidal deformability, are calculated by varying its fraction. The study found that the EOS becomes softer with increasing DM momentum, and the DM has marginal effects on nuclear <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> properties, except for the EOSs and binding energy per particle. The study also calculated the properties of isolated, static, and rotating DM admixed NS and found that the DM has significant effects on both static and rotating NS. We have also observed that a tiny amount of DM can accumulate inside the NS, and more amount of it makes the NS unstable. The study also suggests that the secondary component might be a NS with DM content if the underlying nuclear EOS is sufficiently stiff. The $f$-mode oscillations of the DM admixed hyperon stars are calculated and found that there exist a correlation between canonical $f$-mode frequency and the dimensionless tidal deformability parameter ($Λ_{1.4}$) and we have put a constraint on $f$-mode frequency using GW170817 data. Finally, we have calculated the DM admixed binary NS properties and found that the binary system becomes less deformed and sustains more time in its inspiral phases with the addition of DM. Therefore, we suggest that one can take DM inside the compact objects while modeling the inspiral waveforms for the BNS systems.\n",
      "3        Radiative emissions from electrons and positrons generated by <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> (DM) annihilation or decay are one of the most investigated signals in indirect searches of WIMPs. Ideal targets must have large ratio of DM to baryonic <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>. However, such ``<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span>&#39;&#39; systems have a poorly known level of magnetic turbulence, which determines the residence time of the electrons and positrons and therefore also the strength of the expected signal. This typically leads to significant uncertainties in the derived DM bounds. In a novel approach, we compute the self-confinement of the DM-induced electrons and positrons. Indeed, they themselves generate irregularities in the magnetic field, thus setting a lower limit on the presence of the magnetic turbulence. We specifically apply this approach to dwarf spheroidal galaxies. Finally, by comparing the expected synchrotron emission with radio data from the direction of the Draco galaxy collected at the Giant Metre Radio Telescope, we show that the proposed approach can be used to set robust and competitive bounds on WIMP DM.\n",
      "4        The particle origin of <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> (DM) is still one of the main puzzles in modern physics. One of the most promising search strategy to detect DM at laboratories is through the indirect search of cosmic particles that are produced from DM annihilation in space. In particular, the flux of cosmic positrons has been measured with high precision by the AMS-02 experiment demonstrating that an excess above 10 GeV, with respect to the secondary production, is present. We study in this paper the possible DM origin of the positron excess finding the values of the DM mass $M$ and annihilation cross section $\\langle σv \\rangle$ that are needed to fit high-energy positron data. In particular, we find that for DM annihilating into $b\\bar{b}$ it is required to have $M=43$ TeV and $\\langle σv \\rangle = 10^{-21}$ cm$^3$/s while for $τ^+τ^-$ $M=2$ TeV and $\\langle σv \\rangle = 3\\times 10^{-23}$ cm$^3$/s. If DM produce positrons, they are expected to generate gamma rays from the center of the Milky Way and around dwarf galaxy satellites of the Galaxy. We thus combine the values for the DM mass and annihilation cross section obtained with the fit to AMS-02 positron data with the upper limits derived with the non-detection of $γ$ rays with HESS in the direction of the Galactic center and Fermi-LAT for the combined analysis of dwarf galaxies. The main result of the paper is that only DM annihilating into $μ^+ μ^-$ with a mass around 500 GeV and $\\langle σv \\rangle = 4\\times 10^{-24}$ cm$^3$/s can fit AMS-02 data and be compatible with the upper limits found with $γ$ rays. As for the $τ^+ τ^-$ ($b\\bar{b}$) channel, DM can contribute at most at a few tens $\\%$ (a few \\%) level.\n",

      "7        Recent observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) are yielding tantalizing hints of an early population of massive, bright galaxies at $z &gt; 10$, with Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) observations indicating significant dust masses in place as early as $z\\sim 7$. To understand the implications of these observations, we use the DELPHI semi-analytic model that jointly tracks the assembly of <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halos and their constituent baryons, including the key processes of dust enrichment. Our model employs only two redshift- and mass-independent free parameters that are tuned against all available galaxy data at $z \\sim 5-9$ before it is used to make predictions up to $z \\sim 20$. Our key results are: (1) the model progressively under-predicts the observed ultraviolet luminosity function (UV LF) at $z &gt; 12$; observations at $z&gt;16$ lie close to, or even above, a &#34;maximal&#34; model where all available gas is turned into stars; (2) UV selection would miss 34% of the star formation rate density at $z \\sim 5$, decreasing to 17% by $z \\sim 10$ for bright galaxies with $\\rm{M_{UV}} &lt; -19$; (3) the dust mass ($M_d$) evolves with the stellar mass ($M_*$) and redshift as $\\log(M_d) = 1.194\\log(M_*) + 0.0975z - 5.433$; (4) the escape fraction of UV photons ($f_{\\rm esc}^{\\rm UV}$) decreases with increasing mass and star formation rate. At $z \\sim 7$, $f_{\\rm esc}^{\\rm UV} \\sim 0.8~(0.1)$ for $M_* \\sim 10^9~ (10^{11}) \\, M_\\odot$ galaxies; (5) the dust temperature increases with stellar mass, ranging between $30-33$ K for $M_* \\sim 10^{9-11}M_\\odot$ galaxies at $z \\sim 7$. Finally, we predict the far infrared (FIR) LF at $z \\sim 5-20$, testable with ALMA observations, and caution that spectroscopic redshifts and dust masses must be pinned down before invoking unphysical extrema in galaxy formation models.\n",
      "8        We reexamine the consequences of perturbative unitarity on <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> freeze-out when both Sommerfeld enhancement and bound state formation affect <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> annihilations. At leading order (LO) the annihilation cross-section is infrared dominated and the connection between the unitarity bound and the upper bound on the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> mass depends only on how the different partial waves are populated. We compute how this picture is modified at next-to-leading order (NLO) with the goal of assigning a reliable theory uncertainty to the freeze-out predictions. We explicitly compute NLO corrections in a simple model with abelian gauge interactions and provide an estimate of the theoretical uncertainty for the thermal masses of heavy electroweak $n$-plets. Along the way, we clarify the regularization and matching procedure necessary to deal with singular potentials in quantum mechanics with a calculable relativistic UV completion.\n",
      "9        We provide an algorithm for evolving general spin-$s$ Gross-Pitaevskii / non-linear Schrödinger systems carrying a variety of interactions, where the $2s+1$ components of the `spinor&#39; field represent the different spin-multiplicity states. We consider many nonrelativistic interactions up to quartic order in the Schrödinger field (both short and long-range, and spin-dependent and spin-independent interactions), including explicit spin-orbit couplings. The algorithm allows for spatially varying external and/or self-generated vector potentials that couple to the spin density of the field. Our work can be used for scenarios ranging from laboratory systems such as spinor Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs), to cosmological/astrophysical systems such as self-interacting bosonic <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>. As examples, we provide results for two different setups of spin-$1$ BECs that employ a varying magnetic field and spin-orbit coupling, respectively, and also collisions of spin-$1$ solitons in <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>. Our symplectic algorithm is second-order accurate in time, and is extensible to the known higher-order accurate methods.\n",
      "10        We discuss the production of primordial black holes in an early <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> dominated era, which typically takes place in string inspired early universe cosmological models. In particular, we consider a pre-big bang scenario (extending previous results regarding formation in the radiation dominated era) where the enhancement of curvature perturbations is induced by a variation of the sound-speed parameter c_s during the string phase of high-curvature inflation. After imposing all relevant observational constraints, we find that the considered class of models is compatible with the production of a large amount of primordial black holes, in the mass range relevant to <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>, only for a small range of the parameters space. On the other hand, we find that a huge production of light primordial black holes may occur both in such <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> dominated era and in the radiation dominated one.\n",
      "11        We explore an extension of the standard $Λ$CDM model by including an interaction between neutrinos and <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>, and making use of the ground based telescope data of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT). An indication for a non-zero coupling between <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> and neutrinos (both assuming a temperature independent and $T^2$ dependent cross-section) is obtained at the 1$σ$ level coming from the ACT CMB data alone and when combined with the Planck CMB and Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) measurements. This result is confirmed by both fixing the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom in the early Universe to the Standard Model value of $N_{\\rm eff}=3.044$, and allowing $N_{\\rm eff}$ to be a free cosmological parameter. Furthermore, when performing a Bayesian model comparison, the interacting $ν$DM (+$N_{\\rm eff}$) scenario is mostly preferred over a baseline $Λ$CDM (+$N_{\\rm eff}$) cosmology. The preferred value is then used as a benchmark and the potential implications of <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter&#39;s</span> interaction with a sterile neutrino are discussed.\n",
      "12        We present an innovative approach to constraining the non-cold <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> model using a convolutional neural network (CNN). We perform a suite of hydrodynamic simulations with varying <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> particle masses and generate mock 21cm radio intensity maps to trace the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> distribution. Our proposed method complements the traditional power spectrum analysis. We compare our CNN classification results with those from the power spectrum of the differential brightness temperature map of 21cm radiation, and find that the CNN outperforms the latter. Moreover, we investigate the impact of baryonic physics on the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> model constraint, including star formation, self-shielding of HI gas, and UV background model. We find that these effects may introduce some contamination in the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> constraint, but they are insignificant when compared to the realistic system noise of the SKA instruments.\n",
      "13        The <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> power spectrum has been strongly constrained by astronomical measurements at large scales, but only weakly at small scales. Compared with the standard scenario, the deviation of the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> power spectrum at small scales has influence on the cosmological structure formation, e.g., the comoving number density of <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halos. The thermal history of the intergalactic medium (IGM) can be changed if <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> is made of weakly interacting massive particles and can annihilate into standard model particles. The changes of the evolution of IGM could leave imprints on the relevant astronomical observations. Taking into account the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> annihilation, we investigate the impact of the deviation of <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> power spectrum at small scales on the global 21-cm signal. In view of the measurements of the global 21-cm signal by the EDGES experiment, we explore the allowed parameter space of $m_s$, which describes the degree of deviation, by requiring the differential brightness temperature of the global 21-cm signal $δT_{21} \\le -50~\\rm mK$ at redshift $z=17$.\n",
      "14        Using Low Brightness Surface Galaxies (LBSG) rotational curves we inferred the free parameters of $\\ell$-boson stars as a <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> component. The $\\ell$-boson stars are numerical solutions to the non-relativistic limit of the Einstein-Klein-Gordon system, the Schrödinger-Poisson (SP) system. These solutions are parametrized by an angular momentum number $\\ell = (N-1)/2$ and an excitation number $n$. We perform a bayesian analysis by modifying the SimpleMC code to perform the parameter inference, for the cases with $\\ell = 0$, $\\ell = 1$ and multistates of $\\ell$-boson stars. We used the Akaike information criterion (AIC), Bayesian information criterion and the Bayes factor to compare the excited state ($\\ell$=1) and the multistate case with the ground state ($\\ell$=0) as the base model due to its simplicity. We found that the data in most galaxies in the sample favours the multistates case and that the scalar field mass tends to be slightly bigger than the ground state case.\n",
      "15        A long-standing observed curiosity of globular clusters (GCs) has been that both the number and total mass of GCs in a galaxy are linearly correlated with the galaxy&#39;s virial mass, whereas its stellar component shows no such linear correlation. This work expands on an empirical model for the numbers and ages of GCs in galaxies presented by Valenzuela et al. (2021) that is consistent with recent observational data from massive elliptical galaxies down to the dwarf galaxy regime. Applying the model to simulations, GC numbers are shown to be excellent tracers for the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> (DM) virial mass, even when distinct formation mechanisms are employed for blue and red GCs. Furthermore, the amount of DM smooth accretion is encoded in the GC abundances, therefore providing a measure for an otherwise nearly untraceable component of the formation history of galaxies.\n",
      "16        We analytically solve the problem of Bose star growth in the bath of gravitationally interacting particles. We find that after nucleation of this object, the bath is described by a self-similar solution of the kinetic equation, which is an attractor. Together with the conservation laws, this fixes mass evolution of the Bose star. Our results explain slowdown of the star growth at a certain &#34;core-halo&#34; mass, but also predict formation of the heavier and lighter objects in magistral <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> models.\n",
      "17        <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">Dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> subhaloes are key for the predictions of simulations of structure formation, but their existence frequently ends prematurely due to two technical issues, namely numerical disruption in N-body simulations and halo finders failing to identify them. Here we focus on the second issue, using the phase-space friends-of-friends halo finder ROCKSTAR as a benchmark (though we expect our results to translate to comparable codes). We confirm that the most prominent cause for losing track of subhaloes is tidal distortion rather than a low number of particles. As a solution, we present a flexible post-processing algorithm that tracks all subhalo particles over time, computes subhalo positions and masses based on those particles, and progressively removes stripped <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>. If a subhalo is lost by the halo finder, this algorithm keeps tracking its so-called ghost until it has almost no particles left or has truly merged with its host. We apply this technique to a large suite of N-body simulations and restore lost subhaloes to the halo catalogues, which has a dramatic effect on key summary statistics of large-scale structure. Specifically, the subhalo mass function increases by about 50% and the halo correlation function increases by a factor of two at small scales. While these quantitative results are somewhat specific to our algorithm, they demonstrate that particle tracking is a promising way to reliably follow haloes and reduce the need for orphan models. Our algorithm and augmented halo catalogues are publicly available.\n",
      "18        Ultralight bosons are predicted in many extensions to the Standard Model and are popular <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> candidates. The black hole superradiance mechanism allows for these particles to be probed using only their gravitational interaction. In this scenario, an ultralight boson cloud may form spontaneously around a spinning black hole and extract a non-negligible fraction of the black hole&#39;s mass. These oscillating clouds produce quasi-monochromatic, long-duration gravitational waves that may be detectable by ground-based or space-based gravitational wave detectors. We discuss the capability of a new long-duration signal tracking method, based on a hidden Markov model, to detect gravitational wave signals generated by ultralight vector boson clouds, including cases where the signal frequency evolution timescale is much shorter than that of a typical continuous wave signal. We quantify the detection horizon distances for vector boson clouds with current- and next-generation ground-based detectors. We demonstrate that vector clouds hosted by black holes with mass $\\gtrsim 60 M_{\\odot}$ and spin $\\gtrsim 0.6$ are within the reach of current-generation detectors up to a luminosity distance of $\\sim 1$ Gpc. This search method enables one to target vector boson clouds around remnant black holes from compact binary mergers detected by gravitational-wave detectors. We discuss the impact of the sky localization of the merger events and demonstrate that a typical remnant black hole reasonably well-localized by the current generation detector network is accessible in a follow-up search.\n",
      "19        Lithium-drifted silicon [Si(Li)] has been used for decades as an ionizing radiation detector in nuclear, particle, and astrophysical experiments, though such detectors have frequently been limited to small sizes (few cm$^2$) and cryogenic operating temperatures. The 10-cm-diameter Si(Li) detectors developed for the General Antiparticle Spectrometer (GAPS) balloon-borne <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> experiment are novel particularly for their requirements of low cost, large sensitive area (~10 m$^2$ for the full 1440-detector array), high temperatures (near -40$\\,^\\circ$C), and energy resolution below 4 keV FWHM for 20--100-keV x-rays. Previous works have discussed the manufacturing, passivation, and small-scale testing of prototype GAPS Si(Li) detectors. Here we show for the first time the results from detailed characterization of over 1100 flight detectors, illustrating the consistent intrinsic low-noise performance of a large sample of GAPS detectors. This work demonstrates the feasibility of large-area and low-cost Si(Li) detector arrays for next-generation astrophysics and nuclear physics applications.\n",

The boosted <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">Dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">Matter</span> flux at the edge of the Earth&#39;s atmosphere is expected to be pointing to the Galactic Center, with a flux 15 to 20 times larger than in the transverse direction.\n",
      "21        We investigate the reach of future gravitational wave (GW) detectors in probing inflaton couplings with visible sector particles that can either be bosonic or fermionic in nature. Assuming reheating takes place through perturbative quantum production from vacuum in presence of classical inflaton background field, we find that the spectral energy density of the primordial GW generated during inflation becomes sensitive to inflaton-<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> coupling. We conclude, obeying bounds from Big Bang Nucleosysthesis and Cosmic Microwave Background, that, e.g., inflaton-scalar couplings of the order of $\\sim\\mathcal{O}(10^{-20})$ GeV fall within the sensitivity range of several proposed GW detector facilities. However, this prediction is sensitive to the size of the inflationary scale, nature of the inflaton-<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> interaction and shape of the potential during reheating. Having found the time-dependent effective inflaton decay width, we also discuss its implications for <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> (DM) production from the thermal plasma via UV freeze-in during reheating. It is shown, that one can reproduce the observed DM abundance for its mass up to several PeVs, depending on the dimension of the operator connecting DM with the thermal bath and the associated scale of the UV physics. Thus we promote primordial GW to observables sensitive to feebly coupled inflaton, which is very challenging if not impossible to test in conventional particle physics laboratories or astrophysical measurements.\n",
      "22        We argue that demanding a consistent cosmological history, including the absence of domain walls and strongly interacting relics at the Peccei-Quinn scale, singles out two concrete realizations of hadronic QCD axions as viable <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> models. These realizations generally feature flavor-violating axion couplings to Standard Model quarks that are unsuppressed at low energies. As a consequence, experiments looking for flavor-violating hadronic processes involving the axion can be sensitive probes of QCD axion <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> models. In particular, we show that the NA62 and KOTO experiments could detect the $K\\rightarrowπ+ a$ decay for axions consistent with the observed <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> abundance via the post-inflationary misalignment mechanism.\n",
      "23        The mean <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> density within the turnaround radius, which is the boundary that separates a nonexpanding structure from the Hubble flow, was recently proposed as a novel cosmological probe. According to the spherical collapse model, the evolution with cosmic time of this turnaround density, $\\rm ρ_{ta}(z)$, can be used to determine both $\\rm Ω_m$ and $Ω_Λ$, independently of any other currently used probe. The properties of $\\rm ρ_{ta}$ predicted by the spherical collapse model were also shown to persist in the presence of full three-dimensional effects in $\\rm Λ$CDM N-body cosmological simulations when considering galaxy clusters at the present time, $z=0$. However, a small offset was discovered between the spherical-collapse prediction of the value of $ρ_{ta}$ at $z=0$ and its value measured in simulations. In this letter, we explore whether this offset evolves with cosmic time; whether it differs in different cosmologies; whether its origin can be confidently identified; and whether it can be corrected. We found that the offset does evolve slightly with redshift, and that it correlates strongly with the deviation from spherical symmetry of the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halo distribution inside and outside of the turnaround radius. We used an appropriate metric to quantify deviations in the environment of a structure from spherical symmetry. We found that using this metric, we can construct a sphericity-selected sample of halos for which the offset of $ρ_{ta}$ from the spherical collapse prediction is zero, independently of redshift and cosmology. We found that a sphericity-selected halo sample allows us to recover the simulated cosmology, and we conclude that the turnaround density evolution indeed encodes the cosmology in N-body simulations.\n",
      "24        We present a new suite of over 1,500 cosmological N-body simulations with varied Warm <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">Dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">Matter</span> (WDM) models ranging from 2.5 to 30 keV. We use these simulations to train Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to infer WDM particle masses from images of DM field data. Our fiducial setup can make accurate predictions of the WDM particle mass up to 7.5 keV at a 95% confidence level from small maps that cover an area of (25 h$^{-1}$ Mpc)$^2$. We vary the image resolution, simulation resolution, redshift, and cosmology of our fiducial setup to better understand how our model is making predictions. Using these variations, we find that our models are most dependent on simulation resolution, minimally dependent on image resolution, not systematically dependent on redshift, and robust to varied cosmologies. We also find that an important feature to distinguish between WDM models is present with a linear size between 100 and 200 h$^{-1}$ kpc. We compare our fiducial model to one trained on the power spectrum alone and find that our field-level model can make 2x more precise predictions and can make accurate predictions to 2x as massive WDM particle masses when used on the same data. Overall, we find that the field-level data can be used to accurately differentiate between WDM models and contain more information than is captured by the power spectrum. This technique can be extended to more complex DM models and opens up new opportunities to explore alternative DM models in a cosmological environment.\n",
      "25        The properties of globular clusters (GCs) contain valuable information of their host galaxies and <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span>-<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halos. In the remarkable example of ultra-diffuse galaxy, NGC5846-UDG1, the GC population exhibits strong radial mass segregation, indicative of dynamical-friction-driven orbital decay, which opens the possibility of using imaging data alone to constrain the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span>-<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> content of the galaxy. To explore this possibility, we develop a semi-analytical model of GC evolution, which starts from the initial mass function, the initial structure-mass relation, and the initial spatial distribution of the GC progenitors, and follows the effects of dynamical friction, tidal evolution, and two-body relaxation. Using Markov Chain Monte Carlo, we forward-model the GCs in a NGC5846-UDG1-like potential to match the observed GC mass, size, and spatial distributions, and to constrain the profile of the host halo and the origin of the GCs. We find that, with the assumptions of zero mass segregation when the star clusters were born, NGC5846-UDG1 is <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span>-<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> poor compared to what is expected from stellar-to-halo-mass relations, and its halo concentration is low, irrespective of having a cuspy or a cored halo profile. Its GC population has an initial spatial distribution more extended than the smooth stellar distribution. We discuss the results in the context of scaling laws of galaxy-halo connections, and warn against naively using the GC-abundance-halo-mass relation to infer the halo mass of UDGs. Our model is generally applicable to GC-rich dwarf galaxies, and is publicly available at https://github.com/JiangFangzhou/GCevo.\n",
      "26        The Epoch of Reionization (EoR) neutral Hydrogen (HI) 21-cm signal evolves significantly along the line-of-sight (LoS) due to the light-cone (LC) effect. It is important to accurately incorporate this in simulations in order to correctly interpret the signal. 21-cm LC simulations are typically produced by stitching together slices from a finite number $(N_{\\rm RS})$ of &#39;&#39;reionization snapshot&#39;&#39;, each corresponding to a different stage of reionization. In this paper, we have quantified the errors in the 21-cm LC simulation due to the finite value of $N_{\\rm RS}$. We show that this can introduce large discontinuities $(&gt; 200 \\%)$ at the stitching boundaries when $N_{\\rm RS}$ is small $(= 2,4)$ and the mean neutral fraction jumps by $δ\\bar{x}_{\\rm HI} = 0.2,0.1$ respectively at the stitching boundaries. This drops to $17 \\%$ for $N_{\\rm RS} = 13$ where $δ\\bar{x}_{\\rm HI}=0.02$. We present and also validate a method for mitigating this error by increasing $N_{\\rm RS}$ without a proportional increase in the computational costs which are mainly incurred in generating the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> and halo density fields. Our method generates these fields only at a few redshifts, and interpolates them to generate reionization snapshots at closely spaced redshifts. We use this to generate 21-cm LC simulations with $N_{\\rm RS} = 26,51,101$ and $201$, and show that the errors go down as $N_{\\rm RS}^{-1}$.\n",
      "27        The advent of gravitational wave astronomy has seen a huge influx of new predictions for potential discoveries of beyond the Standard Model fields. The coupling of all fundamental fields to gravity, together with its dominance on large scales, makes gravitational physics a rich laboratory to study fundamental physics. This holds especially true for the search for the elusive <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> photon, a promising <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> candidate. The <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> photon is predicted to generate instabilities in a rotating black hole spacetime, birthing a macroscopic Bose-Einstein condensate. These condensates can especially form around super massive black holes, modifying the dynamical inspiralling process. This then opens another window to leverage future space-borne gravitational wave antennas to join the hunt for the elusive <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> particle. This study builds a preliminary model for the gravitational waveform emitted by such a dressed extreme mass-ratio inspiral. Comparing these waveforms to the vacuum scenario allows projections to the potential constrainability on the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> photon mass by space-borne gravitational wave antennas. The superradiant instability of a massive vector field on a Kerr background is calculated and the modification to the dynamics of an inspiralling solar mass-scale compact object is determined with approximations on the backreaction effect of the cloud on the compact object. The end result is the projection that the LISA mission should be able to constrain the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> photon mass using extreme mass ratio inspirals in the range $[1.8 \\times 10^{-17}, 4.47 \\times 10^{-16}]$ eV.\n",
      "28        Recent observations made by the JWST have revealed a number of massive galaxies at high redshift ($z$). The presence of these galaxies appears at odds with the current $Λ$CDM cosmology. Here we investigate the possibility of alleviating the tension by incorporating uncertainties from three sources in counting massive galaxies at high $z$: cosmic variance, error in stellar mass estimate, and contribution by backsplash. We find that each of the sources can significantly increase the cumulative stellar mass density $ρ_*(&gt;M_*)$ at the high-mass end, and the combination of them can boost the density by more than one order of magnitude. Assuming a star formation efficiency of $ε_* \\sim 0.5$, cosmic variance alone can reduce the tension to $2σ$ level, except the most massive galaxy at $z=8$. Including in addition a lognormal dispersion with a width of 0.3 dex in the stellar mass can bring the observed stellar mass density at $z \\sim 7 - 10$ to the $2σ$ range of the cosmic variance. The tension is completely eliminated when gas stripped from backsplash halos is also taken into account. Our results highlight the importance of fully modeling uncertainties when interpreting observational data of rare objects. We use the constrained simulation, ELUCID, to investigate the descendants of high $z$ massive galaxies. We find that a significant portion of these galaxies end up in massive halos with mass $M_{\\rm halo} &gt; 10^{13} h^{-1}M_\\odot $ at $z=0$. A large fraction of central galaxies in $M_{\\rm halo} \\geqslant 10^{14.5} h^{-1}M_\\odot$ halos today are predicted to contain significant amounts of ancient stars formed in massive galaxies at $z\\sim 8$. This prediction can be tested by studying the structure and stellar population of central galaxies in present-day massive clusters.\n",
      "29        Within the $Λ$CDM cosmology, <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> haloes are comprised of both a smooth component and a population of smaller, gravitationally bound subhaloes. These components are often treated as a single halo when halo properties, such as density profiles, are extracted from simulations. Recent work has shown that density profiles change substantially when subhalo mass is excluded. In this paper, we expand on this result by analysing the change in three specific host halo properties -- concentration ($c_{\\rm{NFW}}$), spin ($λ_{\\rm Bullock}$), and shape ($c/a$), -- when calculated only from the smooth component of the halo. This analysis is performed on both Milky Way-mass haloes and cluster-mass haloes in high-resolution, zoom-in, $N$-body simulations. We find that when subhaloes are excluded the median value of (1) $c_{\\rm{NFW}}$ is enhanced by $\\approx 38 \\pm 12\\%$ and $\\approx 88 \\pm 7.7\\%$ for Milky Way mass ($10^{12.1}\\,\\text{M}_\\odot$) and cluster mass ($10^{14.8}\\,\\text{M}_\\odot$) haloes respectively, (2) $λ_{\\rm Bullock}$ is reduced for Milky Way mass by $\\approx 16 \\pm 6.8\\%$ and cluster mass haloes by $\\approx 32 \\pm 8.9\\%$. Additionally, with the removal of subhaloes, cluster mass haloes tend to become more spherical as the ratio of minor-to-major axis, $c/a$, increases by $\\approx 12 \\pm 4\\%$, whereas Milky Way mass haloes remain approximately the same shape with $c/a$ changed by $\\approx 1.2 \\pm 5.6\\%$. The fractional change of each of these properties depends primarily on the amount of mass that is removed from the halo system and, to a lesser extent, mass accretion history. Our findings demonstrate that the properties of the smooth components of <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> haloes are biased relative to the total mass of the halo including subhaloes.\n",
      "30        In order to test active galactic nucleus (AGN) unification and evolutionary models, we measured the AGN clustering properties as a function of AGN obscuration defined in terms of hydrogen column density, $N_{\\rm H}$. In addition to measuring the clustering of unobscured ($N_{\\rm H} &lt; 10^{22}\\,{\\rm cm}^{-2}$) and moderately obscured ($10^{22} \\leq N_{\\rm H} &lt; 10^{23.5}$) AGNs, we also targeted highly obscured sources ($N_{\\rm H}\\geq 10^{23.5}$) up to redshifts of $z=3$. We have compiled one of the largest samples of X-ray-selected AGNs from a total of eight deep XMM/Chandra surveys. We measured the clustering as a function of both AGN obscuration and redshift using the projected two-point correlation function, $w_{\\rm p}(r_{\\rm p})$. We modeled the large-scale clustering signal, measured the AGN bias, $b(z, N_{\\rm H})$, and interpreted it in terms of the typical AGN host <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halo, $M_{\\rm halo}(z, N_{\\rm H}$). We find no significant dependence of AGN clustering on obscuration, suggesting similar typical masses of the hosting halos as a function of $N_{\\rm H}$. This result matches expectations of AGN unification models, in which AGN obscuration depends mainly on the viewing angle of the obscuring torus. We measured, for the first time, the clustering of highly obscured AGNs and find that these objects reside in halos with typical mass $\\log M_{\\rm halo} = 12.98_{-0.22}^{+0.17} [h^{-1} M_\\odot]$ ($12.28_{-0.19}^{+0.13}$) at low $z \\sim 0.7$ (high $z \\sim 1.8$) redshifts. We find that irrespective of obscuration, an increase in AGN bias with redshift is slower than the expectation for a constant halo mass and instead follows the growth rate of halos, known as the passive evolution track. This implies that for those AGNs the clustering is mainly driven by the mass growth rate of the hosting halos and galaxies across cosmic time.\n",
      "31        Mergers between galaxy clusters are an important stage in the formation of the large-scale structure of the Universe. Some of the mergers show a spectacular bow shock that formed as a result of recent passage of a smaller cluster through a bigger one, the classic example of this being the so-called bullet cluster. In this paper, I describe ten examples of interacting clusters identified among 200 of the most massive objects, with total masses above $1.4 \\times 10^{14}$ M$_{\\odot}$, from the IllustrisTNG300 simulation by searching for prominent bow shocks in their temperature maps. Despite different mass ratios of the two merging clusters, the events are remarkably similar in many respects. In all cases, the companion cluster passed close to the main one only once, between 0.9 and 0.3 Gyr ago, with the pericenter distance of 100-530 kpc and a velocity of up to 3400 km s$^{-1}$. The subcluster, typically an order of magnitude smaller in mass than the main cluster before the interaction, loses most of its <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> and gas in the process. The displacement between the collisionless part of the remnant and the bow shock is such that the remnant typically lags behind the shock or coincides with it, with a single exception of the merger occurring with the largest velocity. Usually about 1% of the gas cells in the merging clusters are shocked, and the median Mach numbers of these gas cells are around two. Due to the relatively small size of the simulation box, no close analog of the bullet cluster was found, but I identified one case that is similar in terms of mass, velocity, and displacement. The presented cases bear more resemblance to less extreme observed interacting clusters such as A520 and Coma.\n",
      "32        Microscopic horizonless relics could form in the early universe either directly through gravitational collapse or as stable remnants of the Hawking evaporation of primordial black holes. In both cases they completely or partially evade cosmological constraints arising from Hawking evaporation and in certain mass ranges can explain the entirety of the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>. We systematically explore the stochastic gravitational-wave background associated with the formation of microscopic <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span>-<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> relics in various scenarios, adopting an agnostic approach and discussing the limitations introduced by existing constraints, possible ways to circumvent the latter, and expected astrophysical foregrounds.

      "33        In direct <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> (DM) detection via scattering off the electrons, the momentum transfer plays a crucial role. Previous work showed that for self-interacting DM, if the DM particle has a size (the so-called puffy DM), the radius effect could dominate the momentum transfer and become another source of velocity dependence for self-scattering cross section. In this work we investigate the direct detection of puffy DM particles with different radii through electron recoil. We find that comparing with the available experimental exclusion limits dominated by the mediator effect for XENON10, XENON100 and XENON1T, the constraints on the puffy DM-electron scattering cross-section become much weaker for large radius DM particles. For small-radius DM particles, the constraints remain similar to the point-like DM case.\n",
      "34        Boson stars are gravitationally bound objects that arise in ultralight <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> models and form in the centers of galactic halos or axion miniclusters. We systematically study the excitations of a boson star, taking into account the mixing between positive and negative frequencies introduced by gravity. We show that the spectrum contains zero-energy modes in the monopole and dipole sectors resulting from spontaneous symmetry breaking by the boson star background. We analyze the general properties of the eigenmodes and derive their orthogonality and completeness conditions which have non-standard form due to the positive-negative frequency mixing. The eigenvalue problem is solved numerically for the first few energy levels in different multipole sectors and the results are compared to the solutions of the Schrödinger equation in fixed boson star gravitational potential. The two solutions differ significantly for the lowest modes, but get close for higher levels. We further confirm the normal mode spectrum in 3D wave simulations where we inject perturbations with different multipoles. As an application of the normal mode solutions, we compute the matrix element entering the evaporation rate of a boson star immersed in a hot axion gas. The computation combines the use of exact wavefunctions for the low-lying bound states and of the Schrödinger approximation for the high-energy excitations.\n",
      "35        If long-range attractive forces exist and are stronger than gravity then cosmic halo formation can begin in the radiation-dominated era. We study a simple realization of this effect in a system where <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> fermions have Yukawa interactions mediated by scalar particles, analogous to the Higgs boson in the standard model. We develop a self-consistent description of the system including exact background dynamics of the scalar field, and precise modelling of the fermion density fluctuations. For the latter, we provide accurate approximations for the linear growth as well as quantitative modelling of the nonlinear evolution using N-body simulations. We find that halo formation occurs exponentially fast and on scales substantially larger than simple estimates predict. The final fate of these halos remains uncertain, but could be annihilation, <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> stars, primordial black holes, or even the existence of galaxy-sized halos at <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>-radiation equality. More generally, our results demonstrate the importance of mapping scalar-mediated interactions onto structure formation outcomes and constraints for beyond the standard model theories.\n",
      "36        Recent analysis on the stellar kinematics of ultra-faint dwarf (UFD) galaxies has put a stringent upper limit on the self-scattering cross section of <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>, i.e., $σ/m&lt;{\\cal O}(0.1)\\,{\\rm cm^2/g}$ at the scattering velocity of ${\\cal O}(10)\\,{\\rm km/s}$. Resonant self-interacting <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> (rSIDM) is one possibility that can be consistent with the UFDs and explain the low central densities of rotation-supported galaxies; the cross section is resonantly enhanced to be $σ/m = {\\cal O}(1)\\,{\\rm cm^2/g}$ around the scattering velocity of ${\\cal O}(100)\\,{\\rm km/s}$ while being suppressed at lower velocities. To further assess this possibility, since the inferred <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> distribution of halos from astrophysical observations is usually compared to that in constant-cross section SIDM (cSIDM), whether the structures of rSIDM halos can be approximated by the cSIDM halo profiles needs to be clarified. In this work, we employ the grovothermal fluid method to investigate the structural evolution of rSIDM halos in a wide mass range. We find that except for halos in a specific mass range, the present structures of rSIDM halos are virtually indistinguishable from those of the cSIDM halos. For halos in the specific mass range, the resonant self-scattering renders a break in their density profile. We demonstrate how such a density-profile break appears in astrophysical observations, e.g., rotation curves and line-of-sight velocity dispersion profiles. We show that for halos above the specific mass range, the density-profile break thermalizes to disappear before the present. We demonstrate that such distinctive thermalization dynamics can leave imprints on the orbital classes of stars with similar ages and metallicities.\n",
      "37        The E-type $α$-attractor models of single-field inflation were generalized further in order to accommodate production of primordial black holes (PBH) via adding a near-inflection point to the inflaton scalar potential at smaller scales, in good agreement with measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation. A minimal number of new parameters was used but their fine-tuning was maximized in order to increase possible masses of PBH formed during an ultra-slow-roll phase leading to a large enhancement of the power spectrum of scalar (curvature) perturbations by 6 or 7 orders of magnitude against the power spectrum of perturbations observed in CMB. It was found that extreme fine-tuning of the parameters in our models can lead to a formation of the Earth-size PBH with the masses of approximately $10^{27}$ g, still in agreement with CMB observations. Quantum corrections are known to lead to the perturbative upper bound on the amplitude of large scalar perturbations responsible for PBH production. The quantum (one-loop) corrections in our models were found to be suppressed by one order of magnitude for PBH with the masses of approximately $10^{19}$ g, which may form the whole <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> in the Universe.\n",
      "38        We discuss in detail the possibility that the &#34;type-II majoron&#34; -- that is, the pseudo Nambu-Goldstone boson that arises in the context of the type-II seesaw mechanism if the lepton number is spontaneously broken by an additional singlet scalar -- account for the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> (DM) observed in the universe. We study the requirements the model&#39;s parameters have to fulfill in order to reproduce the measured DM relic abundance through two possible production mechanisms in the early universe, freeze-in and misalignment, both during a standard radiation-dominated era and early <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> domination. We then study possible signals of type-II majoron DM and the present and expected constraints on the parameter space that can be obtained from cosmological observations, direct detection experiments, and present and future searches for decaying DM at neutrino telescopes and cosmic-ray experiments. We find that -- depending on the majoron mass, the production mechanism, and the value of the vacuum expectation value of the type-II triplet -- all of the three decay modes (photons, electrons, neutrinos) of majoron DM particles can yield observable signals at future indirect searches for DM. Furthermore, in a corner of the parameter space, detection of majoron DM is possible through electron recoil at running and future direct detection experiments.\n",
      "39        Running vacuum models and viscous <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> scenarios beyond perfect fluid idealization are two appealing theoretical strategies that have been separately studied as alternatives to solve some problems rooted in the $Λ$CDM cosmological model. In this paper, we combine these two notions in a single cosmological setting and investigate their cosmological implications, paying particular attention in the interplay between these two constituents in different cosmological periods. Specifically, we consider a well-studied running vacuum model inspired by renormalization group, and a recently proposed general parameterization for the bulk viscosity $ξ$. By employing dynamical system analysis, we explore the physical aspects of the new phase space that emerges from the combined models and derive stability conditions that ensure complete cosmological dynamics. We identify four distinct classes of models and find that the critical points of the phase space are non-trivially renewed compared to the single scenarios. We then proceed, in a joint and complementary way to the dynamical system analysis, with a detailed numerical exploration to quantify the impact of both the running parameter and the bulk viscosity coefficient on the cosmological evolution. Thus, for some values of the model parameters, numerical solutions show qualitative differences from the $Λ$CDM model, which is phenomenologically appealing in light of cosmological observations.\n",
      "40        The intrinsic alignment (IA) of observed galaxy shapes with the underlying cosmic web is a source of contamination in weak lensing surveys. Sensitive methods to identify the IA signal will therefore need to be included in the upcoming weak lensing analysis pipelines. Hydrodynamical cosmological simulations allow us to directly measure the intrinsic ellipticities of galaxies and thus provide a powerful approach to predict and understand the IA signal. Here we employ the novel, large-volume hydrodynamical simulation MTNG740, a product of the MillenniumTNG (MTNG) project, to study the IA of galaxies. We measure the projected correlation functions between the intrinsic shape/shear of galaxies and various tracers of large-scale structure, $w_{+g},\\ w_{+m},\\ w_{++}$ over the radial range $r_{\\rm p} \\in [0.02 , 200]\\,h^{-1}{\\rm Mpc}$ and at redshifts $z=0.0$, $0.5$ and $1.0$. We detect significant signal-to-noise IA signals with the density field for both elliptical and spiral galaxies. We also find significant intrinsic shear-shear correlations for ellipticals. We further examine correlations of the intrinsic shape of galaxies with the local tidal field. Here we find a significant IA signal for elliptical galaxies assuming a linear model. We also detect a weak IA signal for spiral galaxies under a quadratic tidal torquing model. Lastly, we measure the alignment between central galaxies and their host <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span>-<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halos, finding small to moderate misalignments between their principal axes that decline with halo mass.\n",
      "41        We study weak gravitational lensing convergence maps produced from the MillenniumTNG (MTNG) simulations by direct projection of the mass distribution on the past backwards lightcone of a fiducial observer. We explore the lensing maps over a large dynamic range in simulation mass and angular resolution, allowing us to establish a clear assessment of numerical convergence. By comparing full physics hydrodynamical simulations with corresponding <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span>-<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>-only runs we quantify the impact of baryonic physics on the most important weak lensing statistics. Likewise, we predict the impact of massive neutrinos reliably far into the non-linear regime. We also demonstrate that the &#34;fixed &amp; paired&#34; variance suppression technique increases the statistical robustness of the simulation predictions on large scales not only for time slices but also for continuously output lightcone data. We find that both baryonic and neutrino effects substantially impact weak lensing shear measurements, with the latter dominating over the former on large angular scales. Thus, both effects must explicitly be included to obtain sufficiently accurate predictions for stage IV lensing surveys. Reassuringly, our results agree accurately with other simulation results where available, supporting the promise of simulation modelling for precision cosmology far into the non-linear regime.\n",
      "42        An era of kination occurs when the Universe&#39;s energy density is dominated by a fast-rolling scalar field. <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">Dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> that is thermally produced during an era of kination requires larger-than-canonical annihilation cross sections to generate the observed <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> relic abundance. Furthermore, <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> density perturbations that enter the horizon during an era of kination grow linearly with the scale factor prior to radiation domination. We show how the resulting enhancement to the small-scale <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> power spectrum increases the microhalo abundance and boosts the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> annihilation rate. We then use gamma-ray observations to constrain thermal <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> production during kination. The annihilation boost factor depends on the minimum halo mass, which is determined by the small-scale cutoff in the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> power spectrum. Therefore, observational limits on the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> annihilation rate imply a minimum cutoff scale for a given <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> particle mass and kination scenario. For <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> that was once in thermal equilibrium with the Standard Model, this constraint establishes a maximum allowed kinetic decoupling temperature for the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>.

      "43        We present the measurement of total and stellar/<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> decomposed mass density profile around a sample of galaxy groups and clusters with dynamical masses derived from integral-field stellar kinematics from the MaNGA survey in Paper~I and weak lensing derived from the DECaLS imaging survey. Combining the two data sets enables accurate measurement of the radial density distribution from several kpc to Mpc scales. Intriguingly, we find that the excess surface density derived from stellar kinematics in the inner region cannot be explained by simply adding an NFW <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halo extrapolated from lensing measurement at a larger scale to a stellar mass component derived from the NASA-Sloan Atlas (NSA) catalog. We find that a good fit to both data sets requires a stellar mass normalization about 3 times higher than that derived from the NSA catalog, which would require an unrealistically too-heavy initial mass function for stellar mass estimation. If we keep the stellar mass normalization to that of the NSA catalog but allow a varying inner <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> density profile, we obtain an asymptotic slope of $γ_{\\rm gnfw}$= $1.82_{-0.25}^{+0.15}$, $γ_{\\rm gnfw}$= $1.48_{-0.41}^{+0.20}$ for the group bin and the cluster bin respectively, significantly steeper than the NFW case. We also compare the total mass inner density slopes with those from Illustris-TNG300 and find that the values from the simulation are lower than the observation by at least $3σ$ level.\n",
      "44        We present dynamical scaling relations, combined with the stellar population properties, for a subsample of about 6000 nearby galaxies with the most reliable dynamical models extracted from the full MaNGA sample of 10K galaxies. We show that the inclination-corrected mass plane (MP) for both early-type galaxies (ETGs) and late-type galaxies (LTGs), which links dynamical mass, projected half-light radius $R_{\\rm e}$, and the second stellar velocity moment $σ_{\\rm e}$ within $R_{\\rm e}$, satisfies the virial theorem and is even tighter than the uncorrected one. We find a clear parabolic relation between $\\lg(M/L)(&lt;R_{\\rm e})$, the total mass-to-light ratio within a sphere of radius $R_{\\rm e}$, and $\\lgσ_{\\rm e}$, with the $M/L$ increasing with $σ_{\\rm e}$ and for older stellar populations. However, the relation for ETGs is linear and the one for the youngest galaxies is constant. We confirm and improve the relation between average logarithmic total density slopes $γ_{_{\\rm T}}$ and $σ_{\\rm e}$: $γ_{_{\\rm T}}$ become steeper with increasing $σ_{\\rm e}$ until $\\lg(σ_{\\rm e}/{\\rm km\\,s^{-1}})\\approx 2.2$ and then remain constant around $γ_{_{\\rm T}}\\approx -2.2$. The $γ_{_{\\rm T}}-σ_{\\rm e}$ variation is larger for LTGs than ETGs. At fixed $σ_{\\rm e}$ the total density profiles steepen with galaxy age and for ETGs. We find generally low <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> fractions, median $f_{\\rm DM}(&lt;R_{\\rm e})=8$ per cent, within a sphere of radius $R_{\\rm e}$.

      "45        We analyze the global stellar population, radial gradients and non-parametric star formation history of $\\sim 10$K galaxies from the MaNGA Survey final data release 17 (DR17), based on stellar population synthesis and full-spectrum fitting, and relate them with dynamical properties of galaxies. We confirm that stellar population correlates with stellar velocity dispersion $σ_{\\rm e}$ better than with stellar mass $M_{\\ast}$, but also find that younger galaxies are more metal-poor at fixed $σ_{\\rm e}$. Stellar age, metallicity, and mass-to-light ratio $M_{\\ast}/L$ all decrease with galaxy rotation, while radial gradients become more negative (i.e., younger, more metal-poor, and lower $M_{\\ast}/L$ in the outskirts). The trend between metallicity gradients and rotation reverses for slow rotators, which stand out for their more negative metallicity gradients than faster-rotating galaxies. We highlight a population of massive disk galaxies on the green valley, on the $(σ_{\\rm e},\\rm Age)$ plane, that show steep negative age and metallicity gradients, consistent with their old central bulges surrounded by young star-forming disks and metal-poor gas accretion. Galaxies with high $σ_{\\rm e}$, steep total mass-density slope, low <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> fraction, high $M_{\\ast}/L$, and high metallicity have the highest star-formation rate at earlier times, and are currently quenched.

      "46        This is the first paper in our series on the combined analysis of the Dynamics and stellar Population (DynPop) for the MaNGA survey in the final SDSS Data Release 17 (DR17). Here we present a catalogue of dynamically-determined quantities for over 10000 nearby galaxies based on integral-field stellar kinematics from the MaNGA survey. The dynamical properties are extracted using the axisymmetric Jeans Anisotropic Modelling (JAM) method, which was previously shown to be the most accurate for this kind of study. We assess systematic uncertainties using eight dynamical models with different assumptions. We use two orientations of the velocity ellipsoid: either cylindrically-aligned JAM$_{\\rm cyl}$ or spherically-aligned JAM$_{\\rm sph}$. We also make four assumptions for the models&#39; <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> vs. luminous <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> distributions: (1) mass-follows-light, (2) free NFW <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> halo, (3) cosmologically-constrained NFW halo, (4) generalized NFW <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> halo, i.e. with free inner slope. In this catalogue, we provide the quantities related to the mass distributions (e.g. the density slopes and enclosed mass within a sphere of a given radius for total mass, stellar mass, and <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> mass components). We also provide the complete models which can be used to compute the full luminous and mass distribution of each galaxy. Additionally, we visually assess the qualities of the models to help with model selections. We estimate the observed scatter in the measured quantities which decreases as expected with improvements in quality. For the best data quality, we find a remarkable consistency of measured quantities between different models, highlighting the robustness of the results.\n",
      "47        What is the highest energy at which gravitons can be observed? We address this question by studying graviton-to-photon conversion - the inverse-Gertsenshtein effect - in the magnetic field of the Milky Way. We find that above $\\sim 1~\\mbox{PeV}$ the effective photon mass grows large enough to quench the conversion rate. The induced photon flux is comparable to the sensitivity of LHAASO to a diffuse $γ$-ray background, but only for graviton abundances of order $Ω_{\\text{gw}} h^2_0 \\sim 1$. In the future, owing to a better understanding of $γ$-ray backgrounds, larger effective areas and longer observation times, sub-PeV shimmering gravitons with a realistic abundance of $Ω_{\\text{gw}} h^2_0 \\sim 0.01$ could be detected. We show that this is achieved in a cosmologically-motivated scenario of post-recombination superheavy <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> decay. Therefore, the sub-PeV range might be the ultimate energy frontier at which gravitons can be observed.\n",

However, the high-mass end of this relation is not well determined from previous data and shows large scatter. We analyze the globular cluster systems (GCSs) of a homogeneous sample of 11 brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) through DOLPHOT photometry of their deep Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images in the F814W filter. We standardize the definition of $M_{GCS}$, the total GCS mass, by using the GC total population within a limiting radius of $0.1 R_{virial}$, while the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span>-<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halo mass $M_h$ is determined from the weak-lensing calibration of $M_h$ versus $M_{bary}$. When these 11 BCGs are added to the previously studied homogeneous catalogue of Virgo member galaxies, a total value for $η= M_{GCS}/M_h$ is found to be $(3.0\\pm1.8_{internal})\\times10^{-5}$, slightly higher than previous estimates but with much reduced uncertainty. Perhaps more importantly, the results suggest that the relation continues to have a near-linear shape at the highest galaxy masses, strongly reinforcing the conclusion that accreted GCs make a major contribution to the GC populations at high galaxy mass.\n",
      "49        We introduce an analytic surface density profile for <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halos that accurately reproduces the structure of simulated halos of mass $M_{\\rm vir} = 10^{7-11}\\ M_\\odot$, making it useful for modeling line-of-sight perturbers in strong gravitational lensing models. The two-parameter function has an analytic deflection potential and is more accurate than the projected Navarro, Frenk &amp; White (NFW) profile commonly adopted at this mass scale for perturbers, especially at the small radii of most relevant for lensing perturbations. Using a characteristic radius, $R_{-1}$, where the log slope of surface density is equal to $-1$, and an associated surface density, $Σ_{-1}$, we can represent the expected lensing signal from line-of-sight halos statistically, for an ensemble of halo orientations, using a distribution of {\\em projected concentration} parameters, $\\mathcal{C}_{\\rm vir} := r_{\\rm vir}/ R_{-1}$. Though an individual halo can have a projected concentration that varies with orientation with respect to the observer, the range of projected concentrations correlates with the usual three-dimensional halo concentration in a way that enables ease of use.\n",

In a <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> Standard Model (SM) wherein all 6 quark flavors are light while the photon is massive, one finds a rich low-energy spectrum of stable and ultralight particles, in the form of neutral and charged <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> scalars, and complex neutral scalars analogous to the SM kaon, with mass splittings determined by the mass and charge of the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> quarks. The model finds a natural portal to the visible sector via kinetic coupling of the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> and visible photons, and consequent millicharges for <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span>. The <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> can be a mixture of all these ultralight bosonic degrees of freedom, and exhibit both parity-even and parity-odd interactions, making the theory testable at a wide variety of experiments. In context of <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> QCD with $N_f$ flavors of light quarks, this scenario predicts $N_f^2-1$ ultralight axion-like particles -- effectively an axiverse from <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> QCD. This &#39;$π$-axiverse&#39; is consistent with but makes no recourse to string theory, and is complementary to the conventional string theory axiverse.\n",
      "51        The most luminous quasars at $z &gt; 6$ are suspected to be both highly clustered and reside in the most massive <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">dark</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">matter</span> halos in the early Universe, making them prime targets to search for galaxy overdensities and/or protoclusters. We search for Lyman-break dropout-selected galaxies using HST WFC3/ACS broadband imaging in the fields of three $6 &lt; z &lt; 7$ quasars, as well as their simultaneously observed coordinated-parallel fields, and constrain their photometric redshifts using EAZY. One field, J0305-3150, shows a volume density 10$\\times$ higher than the blank-field UV luminosity function (UVLF) at M$_{UV} &lt; -20$, with tentative evidence of a 3$σ$ overdensity in its parallel field located 15 cMpc away. Another field, J2054-0005, shows an angular overdensity within 500 ckpc from the quasar but still consistent with UVLF predictions within 3$σ$, while the last field, J2348-3054, shows no enhancement. We discuss methods for reducing uncertainty in overdensity measurements when using photometric selection and show that we can robustly select LBGs consistent with being physically associated with the quasar, corroborated by existing JWST/NIRCam WFSS data in the J0305 field. Even accounting for incompleteness, the overdensities in J0305 and J2054 are higher for brighter galaxies at short angular separations, suggesting preferential enhancement of more massive galaxies in the immediate vicinity of the quasar. Finally, we compare the LBG population with previously-identified [CII] and mm-continuum companions; the LBG overdensities are not accompanied by an enhanced number of dusty galaxies, suggesting that the overdense quasar fields are not in the bursty star-forming phase sometimes seen in high-redshift protoclusters.\n"
